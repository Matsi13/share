<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen> <some debris hide deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <add more details> <stop before the antiseptic>
The process began with a terrifying gentleness. The nurse, her movements practiced and swift, used a pair of blunt-nosed scissors to cut away the layers of gauze from the night before. With each snip, Jarren flinched, the soft pull on the bandage an agony on his inflamed skin.
When the last layer came off, the wound was revealed. It was worse. Far worse. The raw flesh was no longer just red; it was an angry, swollen purple at the edges. The entire palm was puffy and hot to the touch, a clear sign of the infection raging beneath the surface.
Dr. Adams examined it under a bright lamp, his expression grim. “There,” he said, pointing with the tip of a sterile probe. “You see that discoloration? Right there. There’s something under there. Something deep.”
Cora, who had taken his position by Jarren’s head, rested a hand on his chest. “We’re here, mijo. We’re not going anywhere.”
Jarren was too weak to speak, too lost in the fever to form a coherent thought. He just stared at the ceiling, his eyes wide with a primal, animal terror. His body was trembling uncontrollably, a continuous, violent shiver that had nothing to do with the cold.
“Okay,” Dr. Adams said, picking up a syringe. “I’m going to try to numb the area a little, but with this much inflammation, the lidocaine might not be very effective. It’s the best we can do.”
He administered a series of injections around the perimeter of the wound. Jarren cried out with each needle prick, his body arching off the bed, but it was a weak, pathetic movement compared to the night before. He had no strength left for defiance.
The debridement began.
It was immediately, obviously, a thousand times worse. The tissue, already traumatized and swollen, screamed in protest at the slightest touch. The forceps, which had been instruments of sharp, plucking pain, were now instruments of a deeper, more profound agony as they probed into the inflamed flesh.
Jarren didn’t have the strength to scream anymore. The sounds that came from him were a continuous, high-pitched keen, a sound of a creature being pushed beyond the absolute limits of endurance.
“It’s deeper than I thought,” Dr. Adams muttered, his brow furrowed in concentration. He put down the forceps and picked up a scalpel. “I have to open this pocket up.”
He made a small, precise incision. The inflamed tissue parted, revealing a dark, ugly pocket of infection. And nestled deep within it, almost invisible against the muscle fiber, was a tiny, jagged piece of gravel. It had been there the whole time, a seed of poison.
The doctor’s work became a brutal, microscopic excavation. He had to separate muscle fibers, navigate around tiny nerve endings, all while the nurse irrigated the area to keep his view clear. Each movement of the scalpel, each touch of the forceps in that raw, open pocket, sent a fresh wave of unbearable agony through Jarren’s system.
His mind, unable to process the onslaught, completely detached. His eyes went vacant. His keening subsided into a low, rhythmic moaning, the sound of a man who was no longer present in the room. He was gone, retreated to some deep, dark, silent place within himself where the pain couldn’t follow.
I stood by the wall, my fists clenched, my stomach churning. I felt utterly helpless. This wasn’t a battle we could help him fight. He was on an island of pain, and we were on the shore, watching him drown.
Cora had his forehead pressed against Jarren’s, whispering a constant stream of reassurances that neither of them could truly hear. He was simply providing a human anchor, a point of contact in the storm.
Finally, after a period of time that had lost all meaning, Dr. Adams pulled back, a triumphant, grim look on his face. In the tips of his forceps, he held up the tiny, blood-soaked piece of gravel.
“Got it,” he said, his voice heavy with relief. He dropped it into the metal dish with a victorious clink. He did one final, agonizing sweep of the wound. “Okay. That’s everything. He’s clean.”
He put down the scalpel and looked at the nurse. She picked up the intimidating bottle of Chlorhexidine. The final, terrible act was at hand.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left><add more details on antiseptic>
Dr. Adams put down the scalpel. The excavation was over. The poison was out. But the final trial remained.
The nurse uncapped the bottle of Chlorhexidine. The scent that filled the room was sharp, clinical, and terrifyingly potent. It was the smell of pure, unadulterated chemical power.
Cora, seeing the bottle, tightened his embrace, turning Jarren’s face further into his shoulder as if he could shield him from what was coming. “It’s the last thing, mijo,” he whispered, his voice cracking. “The last thing. Then it’s over. I swear to God.”
Jarren, lost in his feverish, detached state, didn’t seem to register the change. He was a ship adrift, his consciousness submerged. His low, rhythmic moaning was the only sign he was still with us.
Dr. Adams took the bottle from the nurse. “Alright, son,” he said, his voice full of a grim compassion. “Here we go.”
He poured the clear, surgical-grade liquid directly into the newly opened, raw, and bleeding wound.
For a moment, there was only the sound of the liquid. And then Jarren’s body, which had been limp and unresponsive, came back to life.
It was not a scream. He had no strength left for a scream. It was a single, violent, full-body convulsion, as if he’d been struck by lightning. His back arched off the bed with a force that nearly threw Cora off balance. His uninjured hand shot out, grabbing a fistful of the bedsheet, twisting it into a knot. His eyes, which had been vacant, flew wide open, but they saw nothing. They were pure, black pools of agony.
A sound was torn from his throat, a sound I will hear in my nightmares for the rest of my life. It was a long, low, guttural bellow of a soul being shredded. It was the sound of a man being brought to hell for the second time in twenty-four hours.
The antiseptic, far more powerful than the Betadine, was a liquid inferno. It seared the inflamed tissue, burned the exposed nerve endings, and chemically cauterized the wound in a single, excruciating wave.
His body began to thrash on the bed, a wild, uncontrolled bucking. He had no fight left, no conscious will to resist, but his primal nervous system was trying to flee a pain it could not comprehend. It was a purely reflexive, instinctual agony.
“Hold him!” Dr. Adams commanded, as he continued to irrigate the wound, ensuring the antiseptic reached every microscopic crevice.
Cora threw his entire body over Jarren’s torso, pinning him to the bed, absorbing the violent shudders. I rushed forward, grabbing his flailing legs, holding them down. We were no longer comforting him. We were protecting him from himself, from the sheer, animalistic force of his own pain.
The bellowing subsided, his lungs too exhausted to sustain it. It was replaced by a series of sharp, ragged gasps, his body fighting for air amidst the onslaught. His eyes rolled back in his head until only the whites were visible. For a terrifying second, I thought we were losing him.
And then, as quickly as it began, it was over.
Dr. Adams pulled the bottle away. The thrashing ceased. Jarren’s body went completely and utterly limp, a marionette with its strings cut. He fell back onto the pillow, his head lolling to the side. His eyes fluttered closed.
He was unconscious. His body, unable to endure another second of the agony, had simply shut itself down. It had chosen oblivion over the fire.
The room was plunged into a sudden, deafening silence, broken only by the frantic, steady beeping of the heart monitor and the sound of three grown men gasping for breath.
<In the afternoon, Players left to prepare for the game><Casas stayed. He got three days off to protect his knee><The fever threatened to get out of control><Doctor decided to change the bandage, search for more debris, and put stronger antiseptic on the wound><They tried to do so without sedative, given it may be dangerous for Jarren> <add more details> <Stop the scene when the doctors and nurses entered, before they touched Jarren>
By mid-afternoon, the quiet hum of the vigil gave way to the familiar rhythms of a game day. The clubhouse began to fill up, the sounds of preparation—tape being wrapped, music playing, bats being chosen—filtering through the closed door. One by one, the players who had stood watch came to the door of the quiet room, gave a silent nod to whoever was inside, and went to get ready for their job.
The only one who didn’t leave was Triston Casas.
When Alex Cora came by to give him the lineup, he pointed to Triston’s name on the card. “You’re not in today. Or tomorrow. Or the day after. Three days off. Your knees are fine, and they’re going to stay that way. Go home, get some rest.”
Triston just shook his head. “I’m good, Alex. I can play.”
“I know you can,” Cora said. “But you’re not. That’s the new deal, remember? We protect each other. Your job today is here.” He nodded towards Jarren’s bed.
Triston didn’t argue. A look of understanding passed between them. He settled back into his chair, accepting his new role. He was on the injured list of the heart.
But as the afternoon wore on, a new tension began to fill the room. The fever, which had been holding steady, started to climb again. The Tylenol wasn’t holding it back. Jarren’s shivering intensified, his breathing grew more shallow, and his skin felt dangerously hot to the touch.
Jim, the trainer, was in constant motion, his face a mask of deepening concern. He was on the phone with the team’s head physician, Dr. Adams, rattling off numbers and symptoms.
“It’s not responding, doc,” I heard him say, his voice tight. “I think we have to assume there’s still something in there. A foreign body driving the infection.”
The decision was made quickly. Dr. Adams was on his way.
The atmosphere in the room shifted from one of quiet care to one of imminent crisis. This was no longer about comfort; it was about fighting off a serious, escalating infection.
Dr. Adams arrived not alone, but with two nurses from the medical staff. They moved with a swift, no-nonsense efficiency that was completely different from the gentle ministrations of the morning. They brought with them a larger, more intimidating stainless-steel tray. On it, alongside the familiar forceps and scalpels, were syringes, vials, and a bottle of chlorhexidine—a powerful, surgical-grade antiseptic that made the Betadine from the night before look like salt water.
“We need to get this fever down,” Dr. Adams said, his voice calm but authoritative as he snapped on a pair of latex gloves. “Which means we have to go back into that wound. We have to be absolutely certain it’s clean.”
He looked at me. “Craig, we need to do this without a general sedative if we can. Given the stress his system is under, I don’t want to risk depressing his respiratory function. We can give him a local anesthetic, but he’s going to be awake for this. And he’s going to feel the pressure.”
My blood ran cold. Awake. He wanted him to be awake for another debridement.
I looked over at the bed. Jarren was stirring, his eyes fluttering open, hazy and confused by the fever. He saw the new faces, the doctor, the nurses, the terrifying tray of instruments. He didn’t have the strength to fight, but a look of pure, animal terror entered his eyes. He knew. He knew they were going to go back into the fire.
Cora, who had just returned, saw the look on Jarren’s face and immediately moved to the bedside. Triston stood up from his chair, his massive frame a protective wall.
The medical team advanced on the bed. The doctor, the nurses, their faces grim and determined. They were here to save him, but to do so, they first had to take him back to hell.
<Doctors were expecting a weak patient, not a trapped animal with the strength of world class athletic> <Their first attempt only served to wake up the wild animal> <Jarren’s eyes opened, but they were wild, with no consciousness. He was fighting the demons.> <Jarren threw off Casas, Craig and Cora, they backed up into a semi-circle> <add more details> <stop the scene here. Before the second attempt was made.>
Dr. Adams, accustomed to dealing with athletes in controlled medical settings, approached the bed with a calm, clinical demeanor. “Okay, Jarren,” he said, his voice professional and detached. “We’re just going to numb the area a little bit, then we’re going to clean you up. You’ll feel some pressure, but…”
He never finished the sentence.
The moment the nurse touched Jarren’s arm with an alcohol swab to prepare for the local anesthetic, he exploded.
It wasn’t a conscious act. It was a primal, neurological detonation. The fever, the pain, the trauma of the night before, and the new, terrifying threat all converged into a single, violent impulse: escape.
He let out a roar—a raw, guttural sound of pure terror and rage—and launched himself upright. The doctors and nurses, expecting a weak, feverish patient, were completely unprepared for the explosive power of a world-class athlete running on pure adrenaline and fear.
His eyes were open, but there was no one home. They were wide, wild, and utterly vacant, seeing nothing in the room. He was back in the park. He was fighting off the baseballs. He was fighting for his life against the demons only he could see.
“Get away!” he screamed, his voice a shredded wreck.
Cora, Triston, and I reacted on pure instinct, throwing ourselves forward to try and contain him, to prevent him from ripping out his IV or further injuring his hand. It was like trying to hold onto a lightning strike.
He threw his arms out, a blind, thrashing movement of incredible force. Triston, who had grabbed his left arm, was thrown backward as if he’d been hit by a lineman, stumbling into the medical tray with a deafening crash of metal and glass. Cora, trying to hold his shoulders, was shoved back with so much power that he tripped and fell to the floor. I had his legs, but a single, convulsive kick sent me staggering back into the wall.
In the space of three seconds, the room was chaos. The medical team was pressed against the far wall, their faces a mixture of shock and fear. Cora was scrambling to his feet. Triston was untangling himself from the wreckage of the medical tray.
And Jarren… Jarren was standing in the middle of the room, half-crouched like a cornered animal. His hospital gown was torn at the shoulder, his chest heaving, his bandaged hand held protectively against his body. His wild eyes darted around the room, seeing threats everywhere. He was panting, his breath coming in ragged, shallow gasps. He was a trapped animal, surrounded by predators, ready to fight to the death.
We slowly, cautiously, formed a loose circle around him. Our hands were up, palms open, a universal sign of peace.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice low and steady, trying to cut through the fog of his delirium. “It’s Craig. You’re safe. No one is going to hurt you.”
“Easy, son,” Cora said, his voice trembling slightly. “Easy, mijo. It’s us. It’s Alex.”
But he didn’t hear us. He just kept turning in the circle, his eyes wild and unseeing, his body coiled like a spring, ready for the next attack. We had lost him completely. He was alone in his nightmare, and we were locked out.
<the first doctor who was brave enough stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. His aim was ture. The doctor fell on his backside. It almost gave the doctor a haricut.> <Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning> <It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done> <add more details> <stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
The standoff was absolute. A tense, terrifying silence filled the room, broken only by Jarren’s ragged, panicked breathing. He was a caged tiger, and we were the fools who had opened the door.
Dr. Adams, recovering his composure, decided to reassert his authority. He was a doctor, this was his patient, and he would not be intimidated. He took a single, deliberate step forward, crossing the invisible line that separated our cautious circle from Jarren’s zone of terror.
“Jarren, that’s enough,” he said, his voice firm, trying to project a command he did not feel. “You need to lie back down. Now.”
It was a catastrophic miscalculation.
Jarren’s head snapped towards the doctor, his wild eyes locking onto the new threat. With a speed that was utterly inhuman for a man in his condition, his good hand shot out and grabbed a heavy glass water pitcher from the bedside table—one of the few things not sent flying in the initial explosion.
He didn’t hesitate. With a guttural roar, he hurled it.
The pitcher flew across the room with terrifying velocity and accuracy. Dr. Adams, his eyes wide with shock, had just enough time to duck. The glass pitcher shattered against the wall precisely where his head had been a split second before, exploding in a shower of glass and water. A single, large shard spun through the air and sliced a clean line through the doctor’s white coat at the shoulder. He stumbled backward and fell hard onto his backside, staring at the hole in his coat, his face ashen.
The message was unequivocal. This was not a negotiation.
One of the nurses, seeing her boss go down, let out a small scream. Any thought of approaching Jarren vanished. They were medical professionals, not animal tamers. They huddled by the door, their faces pale.
“Okay,” Dr. Adams said, his voice shaky as he scrambled back to his feet. “Okay. That’s it.” He looked at me, his clinical detachment gone, replaced by a grim necessity. “We can’t do this. It’s impossible. He’s going to hurt himself or someone else. We have to sedate him. A full sedative. It’s the only way.”
I looked at the syringe of local anesthetic lying on the floor amidst the broken glass. Then I looked at Jarren. He was still in his half-crouch, his chest heaving, his eyes darting between us, ready to repel the next assault. He was a danger to everyone in the room, but most of all, to himself.
The risks of a full sedative were real, especially for a system already under so much stress. But the risks of not treating the infection were greater. And the risks of trying to approach him again were unacceptable.
I hated it. It felt like a violation, like a defeat. But the doctor was right. We were out of options.
“Do it,” I said, my voice heavy.
The problem remained: how to administer it? No one could get near him. The nurse holding the syringe looked at Jarren, then at the broken glass, and shook her head, her hands trembling.
The room was at an impasse. We had a wild, terrified man, a critical medical need, and no safe way to bridge the gap between them. We were trapped in a nightmare of our own making.
<Cora realized it was the white uniform and scent of antiseptic on the medical staff that scared Jarren. That’s why the line for doctors was further than the line for him and Craig> <He saw the helplessness beneath the rage.  A kid who defied the authority twice and was afraid of the punishment.><Jarren was trapped and couldn’t find the way out. Surrender might bring punishment, but resist might make matters worse><add more details><stop the scene before Cora made the move>
The impasse was absolute. The air was thick with the scent of fear, antiseptic, and failure. Dr. Adams was conferring with the nurses in hushed, urgent tones, trying to formulate a plan to administer the sedative, but every scenario seemed to end with another violent confrontation.
I stood my ground, my eyes locked on Jarren, trying to project a calm I didn’t feel. But my mind was racing. How did we get here? How do we get out?
It was Cora who saw it.
His gaze wasn’t on Jarren’s wild eyes or his coiled posture. It was on the space between us. He noticed that while Jarren kept the medical staff pinned against the far wall, he allowed me, Triston, and Cora himself to remain in a much tighter circle. The invisible line of his terror was drawn differently for us.
Cora’s eyes then darted to the white coats of the doctor and nurses, to the gleaming metal of the fallen instruments, to the dark brown stain of Betadine on a discarded piece of gauze. And he understood.
He looked at me, his expression one of dawning, heartbreaking realization. “It’s the white coats,” he murmured, his voice so low only I could hear it. “It’s the smell. He’s not seeing doctors. He’s seeing… something else. The source of the pain.”
Then he looked back at Jarren, and his perception shifted again. He wasn’t just seeing a wild animal anymore. He was seeing past the rage, past the terror, to the root cause. He saw the boy from the stories. The boy who had been punished with pain for his failures.
He saw a child who had just defied authority—first by refusing the scalpel, and now this, this violent explosion. A child terrified of the inevitable, brutal punishment that must surely follow such defiance.
Jarren was trapped in an impossible loop. To surrender now felt like accepting a punishment he couldn’t bear. To continue resisting felt like it would only make that punishment worse when it finally came. He was a boy in a corner, with no good moves left, lashing out because it was the only thing he could do.
Cora’s face softened, the last vestiges of fear replaced by a deep, paternal sorrow. He saw the utter helplessness beneath the rage. He saw the terrified child who had no way out.
He looked at me again, and his eyes conveyed a clear message. The doctors can’t do this. The coaches can’t do this. I have to.
He took a slow, deep breath, steeling himself. He was about to step into the cage. Not as a manager, not as a trainer, but as the one thing Jarren might still be able to hear.
A father.

 <Cora stepped up with open hands, showing he had nothing to hurt Jarren> <Jarren seemed to regard Cora as less of a threat. Reluctantly let Cora came near.> <Cora coaxed Jarren into going back to the bed, holding him like his own son> <Craig and Casas held Jarren down> <the medical staff tried to do this without sedative> <add more details> <stop the scene before their second attempt>
Cora took a single, deliberate step forward, crossing the invisible line.
Jarren’s head snapped towards him, a low growl rumbling in his chest. His body tensed, ready to spring.
But Cora didn’t stop. He kept his hands open, palms forward, a gesture of complete submission. He wasn’t wearing a white coat. He didn’t smell of antiseptic. He was just Alex.
“Mijo,” Cora said, his voice a low, soothing murmur, the sound he’d used the night before. “It’s just me. It’s just Alex. No doctors. No needles. Just me.”
He took another slow step. Jarren watched him, his wild eyes filled with a deep, primal confusion. He was a threat, but he wasn’t the threat. The growl subsided into a wary, suspicious silence. He reluctantly, grudgingly, allowed Cora to close the distance.
Cora didn’t reach for him. He didn’t try to restrain him. He just came to a stop a few feet away, still holding his empty hands out.
“I know you’re scared, son,” Cora said, his voice thick with an empathy that cut through the delirium. “I know it hurts. But this fight… you’re fighting the wrong people. We’re not the ones hurting you. We’re trying to help. You have to let us help.”
He took the final step, closing the space between them. He slowly, gently, placed his hands on Jarren’s shoulders. Jarren flinched, but he didn’t pull away. The fight was draining out of him, replaced by a profound, exhausted confusion.
“Come on,” Cora whispered, his voice breaking. “Let’s go back to the bed. Let’s finish this. Then it’s over. I promise you, it’s over.”
He began to gently guide Jarren backward, step by agonizing step. Jarren was pliant now, the rage extinguished, leaving only the terrified child. Cora eased him down onto the edge of the bed, then wrapped his arms around him, pulling him into a fierce, protective embrace, shielding his eyes from the sight of the medical staff.
“I got you,” Cora murmured into his ear. “I’m not going anywhere.”
This was our chance.
I looked at Dr. Adams and gave a sharp, urgent nod. Now.
The doctor, understanding the fragile truce, motioned for one of the nurses. He whispered, “No sedative. Let’s try. Just the local.”
As the nurse prepared a fresh syringe, I moved in, along with Triston. We didn’t hesitate. We knew what we had to do.
I took my position behind Jarren again, my arms wrapping around his torso, pinning his good arm to his side. My body became a human straitjacket, my chin resting on his shoulder, my voice a low murmur in his ear. “We’re here, J. We’re not letting go.”
Triston moved to his left. He took Jarren’s injured arm, his grip firm but gentle, holding it steady, presenting it to the medical team. He was the anchor.
Cora remained in front, a human shield, his embrace blocking Jarren’s view of what was to come, his voice a constant, soothing presence.
We had him. A three-man cocoon of trust and force.
Dr. Adams and the nurse approached the bed again, their movements slow, cautious, like approaching a sleeping lion. The nurse held the syringe with the local anesthetic. The doctor held a fresh pair of forceps.
They were ready to go back into the fire. And this time, there would be no retreat.
<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen> <some debris hide deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <Getting those debris out almost unleashed the wild animal again.><They managed to calm Jarren down> <add more details> <stop before the antiseptic>
The nurse, her hands surprisingly steady, found a small patch of unbroken skin on Jarren’s forearm. “Little stick, Jarren,” she whispered, though it was unclear if he could hear her. The needle went in.
The local anesthetic would take a minute to work, and it would only numb the surface. It would do nothing for the deep, throbbing, inflammatory pain that had already set in. The wound was no longer just a raw patch of skin; it was an angry, swollen, pulsating center of agony.
Dr. Adams took a deep breath and picked up a fresh pair of forceps. “Okay,” he said, his voice low and grim. “Going in.”
The moment the metal touched the inflamed tissue, Jarren’s body erupted.
It was worse than before. The pain was magnified, amplified by the swelling and the fever. A strangled, agonized scream was ripped from his throat, muffled by Cora’s jacket. His body convulsed with a violence that was terrifying, a desperate, neurological rejection of the agony.
My arms, wrapped around his chest, strained against the sheer force of his muscles. It was like trying to hold onto a bucking bull. “Hold on!” I grunted, my own voice strained. “We’ve got him!”
Triston, his face a grimace of concentration, leaned all of his 250 pounds into holding the arm steady. “He’s fighting it! Doc, hurry!”
“There’s something deep,” Dr. Adams said, his voice tight with focus, his own forehead beaded with sweat. “It’s under the fascia… buried in the muscle fibers.”
He had to probe deeper. The forceps pushed into a place they were never meant to go.
That was when the wild animal almost broke free again.
Jarren let out a roar of pure, unadulterated fury and pain. He thrashed his head back, catching Cora on the chin. Cora grunted in pain but didn’t let go. Jarren’s legs kicked out, knocking over the IV stand with a crash. He was trying to throw us off, to escape the unendurable.
“Talk to him, Alex!” I yelled, my own voice raw.
Cora, rubbing his jaw, pressed his face back against Jarren’s. “I know! I know, mijo! It’s the last one! I swear to God, it’s the last one! Stay with me! Don’t go! Stay with us!”
His voice, filled with a desperate, paternal love, seemed to find a crack in the wall of pain and delirium. The thrashing subsided, just slightly. The roars quieted into a continuous, agonized moan. He wasn’t calm, but he was no longer trying to tear the room apart. He had retreated back inside, to a place of pure endurance.
“I’ve got it,” Dr. Adams said, his voice triumphant. He pulled the forceps back, and at the tip was a jagged, dark grey piece of gravel, shockingly large, slick with blood. It had been buried deep within the muscle itself, the source of the escalating infection.
He dropped it into the metal dish with a sharp clink that seemed to echo with finality.
He quickly probed the wound one last time. “That’s it,” he said, his voice heavy with relief. “We’re clear. It’s clean.”
The debridement was over. For real this time.
We all remained in our positions, a tableau of exhaustion and shared trauma. Jarren was limp again, his body trembling with aftershocks, his breathing coming in ragged, shallow gasps. He was spent.
But we all knew what was coming next. The fire.
Dr. Adams looked at the nurse. She was holding the bottle of chlorhexidine, her expression one of deep pity. It was time for the final, terrible step.
<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen> <several pieces of debris hide deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <Getting those debris out almost unleashed the wild animal again.><They managed to calm Jarren down> <add more details> <stop before the antiseptic>
The nurse, her hands surprisingly steady, found a small patch of unbroken skin on Jarren’s forearm. “Little pinch, Jarren,” she whispered, though it was unclear if he could even hear her. The needle went in.
The local anesthetic began its work, but it was a single firefighter trying to quell a forest fire. The surface of the wound might be numbing, but the deep, throbbing, inflammatory pain was a raging inferno.
Dr. Adams took a deep breath and picked up the forceps. “Okay,” he said, his voice a low, grim command. “Going in.”
The moment the metal touched the inflamed tissue, Jarren’s body erupted.
It was worse than before. The wound, now swollen and angry, was a minefield of screaming nerve endings. The partial numbness only seemed to make the deep pressure more violating, more terrifying.
He let out a choked, agonized roar, a sound muffled by Cora’s chest. His body convulsed with a strength that was shocking, even after what we’d already seen. He was a fish on a hook, thrashing against the inevitable.
“Hold him!” Dr. Adams grunted, his own face beaded with sweat as he tried to focus on the microscopic work.
My arms, wrapped around Jarren’s chest, strained against the violent spasms. It was like trying to hold onto a bucking bull. “I’ve got him! I’ve got him!” I gasped, my own muscles screaming in protest.
Triston, his face a mask of grim determination, leaned his full weight onto Jarren’s arm, his knuckles white. “It’s okay, J! It’s okay!” he yelled over the sounds of the struggle.
“There’s one,” Dr. Adams said, his voice tight with concentration. “It’s deep. It’s under the fascia.”
He put down the forceps and picked up a small, curved hemostat, a tool for clamping and pulling. He probed the wound.
Jarren’s back arched so violently it lifted me off the floor for a second. The wild animal was trying to break free again. His legs kicked out, sending a nearby stool flying across the room.
“He’s going to break free!” the nurse cried out, backing away.
“NO, HE’S NOT!” Cora roared, his voice a thunderclap of absolute command that cut through the chaos. He tightened his embrace, turning it into an unbreakable lock. “You stay with me, Jarren! You hear me?! YOU STAY WITH ME!”
His voice, that of a manager, a mentor, a father, seemed to penetrate the delirium. The thrashing lessened, just slightly. The violent convulsions subsided back into intense, full-body tremors. He wasn’t calm, but he was contained. He had heard the command from the one person he might still obey.
“Got it,” Dr. Adams breathed, pulling the hemostat back. A tiny, dark, almost invisible speck of debris was clamped in its jaws. He dropped it into the metal dish with a triumphant tink.
He went back in. Again, the struggle. Again, the roar from Cora. Again, the straining muscles of me and Triston. It was a brutal, ugly, violent dance. We were a living machine, a human press, designed for the sole purpose of holding one man together while he was being taken apart.
One by one, the doctor hunted down the deeply embedded particles, each one a fresh battle, each one threatening to unleash the wild animal again. And each time, the three of us, through sheer will and brute force, managed to pull him back from the brink.
Finally, after an eternity of struggle, Dr. Adams leaned back, his white coat stained with sweat and flecks of blood.
“That’s it,” he said, his voice heavy with exhaustion and relief. “I’m sure of it this time. It’s clean.”
The wound was a brutal landscape, but it was pure. The infection had lost its hiding place.
The worst was over. Or so we thought. Because then, the nurse picked up the bottle of chlorhexidine.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <Cora coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts> <add more details>
The sharp, sterile, almost metallic scent of the chlorhexidine cut through the air. It was a smell that bypassed memory and went straight to the nervous system. It was the smell of pure, chemical pain.
It sliced through Jarren’s delirious fog like a knife.
His head snapped up from Cora’s chest. His eyes, though still hazy with fever, were suddenly lucid with a new, specific terror. He saw the nurse uncapping the bottle. He knew what was coming.
The wild animal was gone. The terrified child was back.
“No,” he whispered, the word a fragile, broken thing. He started to shake his head, a slow, pleading motion. “Alex, no. Please.”
He looked past Cora, his desperate gaze finding mine. “Craig… please don’t. Don’t make me.”
His eyes, filled with a heartbreaking clarity, shifted to Triston. “Casas… man, tell them. Tell them to stop.”
He was appealing to us, not as authority figures, but as human beings. He was begging for mercy from the very men who were holding him down. The irony was devastating.
My arms, still locked around him, felt like the bars of a cage. Triston’s grip on his arm, meant to be supportive, now seemed cruel. We were his protectors and his captors all at once.
Cora’s face was a ruin of conflicting duties. He was the father who wanted to soothe the pain, and the general who had to command the charge into fire.
He tightened his embrace, turning Jarren’s face back towards his chest, shielding him from the sight of the bottle.
“Mijo, listen to me,” Cora whispered, his voice thick with an unbearable sorrow. “This is the last step. This is the one that kills the poison. It’s going to be bad. I’m not going to lie to you. It’s going to be the worst part.”
He paused, pressing his cheek against Jarren’s hair. “But when it’s done, the fever will break. The healing will start. The fight will be over. This is the last battle, son. We have to win it.”
Jarren started to sob again, a low, hopeless sound. “I can’t,” he wept. “I can’t do it again. I got nothing left.”
“You don’t have to do it,” Cora said, his voice fierce. “We’re going to do it. You just hold on to me. You hear me? You just hold on tight and let us take it. We’re not leaving you.”
I leaned in, my mouth close to his ear. “It’s a long process, Jarren,” I said, my own voice strained. “It’s not fast. We’re going to be here for every second of it. We’re not going anywhere.”
Triston adjusted his grip, his large hand covering as much of Jarren’s forearm as possible, as if he could absorb some of the pain himself. “We got you, bro,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “We got you.”
It was a promise. A vow. We were preparing him not by telling him it wouldn’t hurt, but by assuring him that the pain would not be solitary.
Jarren went limp again, a final, exhausted surrender. He had pleaded his case and lost. There was no escape. He turned his face into Cora’s shoulder, a child bracing for a punishment he could not comprehend.
I looked at Dr. Adams and gave a single, grim nod. Do it.
The doctor took the bottle from the nurse. The final battle was about to begin.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <Cora coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts> <add more details>
The doctor’s words, “It’s clean,” hung in the air, a promise of imminent release. The tension in my arms, in Triston’s grip, lessened almost imperceptibly. We had survived the storm.
But then the nurse uncapped the bottle of chlorhexidine.
The scent that filled the room was not the familiar, medicinal smell of the Betadine from the night before. This was sharper, more aggressive, a purely chemical odor that smelled of sterile operating rooms and ultimate, uncompromising cleansing.
The smell cut through Jarren’s feverish, delirious fog like a shard of glass.
His head snapped up from Cora’s chest. His eyes, though still hazy, focused with a new, lucid terror. He wasn’t seeing a vague threat anymore. He knew exactly what that bottle meant. He remembered the fire.
“No,” he whispered, the word a fragile, broken thing. The wild animal was gone, replaced by the terrified child, now fully awake and aware of the fresh hell that awaited him.
He looked at Cora, his eyes wide with a desperate, pleading lucidity. “Alex, no. Please. Not again. I can’t.”
He twisted his head, his gaze finding mine. “Craig, please,” he begged, his voice cracking. “Don’t let them. It burns.”
Then his eyes found Triston. “Casas… man, don’t let them do it. Please.”
He was no longer fighting us. He was appealing to us, man to man, brother to brother. He was calling in every chit of loyalty, every ounce of compassion we had. It was a thousand times harder to resist than his physical violence.
My heart shattered. Triston looked like he’d been punched in the gut. But it was Cora who had to be the general.
He took Jarren’s face in his hands, forcing their eyes to meet. His expression was one of profound, soul-deep empathy, but his voice was infused with an unshakeable resolve.
“Mijo, listen to me,” he began, his voice a low, hypnotic murmur. “I know. I know what’s coming. I’m not going to lie to you and say it won’t hurt. It’s going to be hell. But this is a different fire. This is the one that puts the other one out. This is the one that kills the infection. This is the one that lets you keep your hand, your career. This is the last battle. The last one.”
He leaned his forehead against Jarren’s. “I can’t take the pain away. But I can promise you this. I will not leave your side. We will not leave your side. We will take every step of it with you. But you have to take the step. You have to be the strong one, just for a little longer. Can you do that for me? Can you be strong for ten more seconds?”
He was using every managerial tool he had—honesty, empathy, a challenge, a promise of unwavering support. He was asking for one final act of courage.
Jarren stared into his manager’s eyes, his own swimming with tears of terror and exhaustion. He was being asked to willingly walk back into purgatory.
We all knew this wouldn’t be ten seconds. The wound was larger, more inflamed. The antiseptic would have to be applied slowly, methodically. This was going to be a long, agonizing process.
A single tear rolled down Jarren’s cheek. He closed his eyes, a shudder running through his entire body. He gave a tiny, almost imperceptible nod of surrender.
Cora closed his own eyes for a second, a silent prayer of thanks. He then looked at me and Triston, his expression grim. Get ready.
We retook our positions. The human cocoon reformed, tighter this time, braced for a longer, more brutal siege.
Cora looked at the nurse and gave a single, solemn nod. Proceed.
<a split second before the antiseptic was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony> <Jarren was pleading for sanity, but everyone mistook it for mere fear of pain> <Letting Cora guide him back to the bed meant accepting the punishment from his father. > <By coaxing Jarren into accepting the antiseptic, Cora coaxed him back to the park> <The cycle repeats: Jarren got hurt. Jarren play through it. Jarren broke. Jarren went back for more.> <But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment> <add more details> <stop the scene before the antiseptic begins>
We were all in position. The human cocoon was formed, braced for the chemical onslaught. Jarren’s eyes were squeezed shut, his body trembling in anticipation. The nurse, her hand steady, began to tilt the bottle of chlorhexidine. The final battle was seconds away.
And in that split second of silence, in that intake of breath before the plunge, Alex Cora’s world tilted on its axis.
He was looking down at Jarren’s face, at the tear tracks, at the sheer, abject terror of a man willingly marching toward his own torture. And a horrifying thought, cold and sharp as the scalpel, pierced through his managerial resolve.
What is he really afraid of?
It wasn’t just the pain. He’d seen men deal with pain. This was different. This was a terror of the soul.
Cora’s mind flashed back to the night before. To the delirious, heartbreaking cries. “I be better! Daddy!” He remembered the story I had shared with him, the story the young woman had shared with me, about the park, about the baseballs, about the father who punished failure with pain.
And he understood.
The antiseptic wasn’t just a chemical. It was a trigger. A portal. The agony was so absolute, so beyond normal comprehension, that Jarren’s mind had only one framework to process it: the park. The pain was the punishment. The punishment was from his father. To endure the pain was to be the good son, the one who always came back for more.
His coaxing, his speech about being strong for ten more seconds, his plea for Jarren to accept this final trial—he hadn’t been leading him toward healing. He had been leading him back to his abuser.
The realization hit Cora with the force of a physical blow. He felt the blood drain from his face. He had, with the best of intentions, become the voice of the very trauma they were trying to heal. By convincing Jarren to lie back down, to surrender, he had inadvertently forced him to accept his father’s punishment all over again.
The cycle. It was happening right here, in his arms. Jarren gets hurt. Jarren endures. Jarren breaks. And now, Alex Cora, his manager, his mentor, his protector, was telling him to get up and go back for more.
For a horrifying second, Cora wanted to scream, “Stop!” He wanted to rip Jarren from the table, to shield him, to tell the doctors to find another way.
But there was no other way.
The infection was real. The medical necessity was absolute. The path to healing led directly through the heart of his trauma.
Cora was trapped. He had to hold his son down while the ghost of his father administered the punishment. He had to become the enabler to facilitate the cure. It was a monstrous, impossible choice.
He looked at me over Jarren’s head, and in his eyes, I saw it all. The horror, the realization, the self-loathing. I understood immediately. We had both missed it. We had seen the fear of pain, but we had missed the plea for sanity.
There was no time. The nurse was already pouring.
Cora’s face hardened into a mask of grim, tragic resolve. He couldn’t save Jarren from the park this time. All he could do was hold him tighter, to be the one solid, loving thing in the middle of the fire, and pray that this time, when it was over, they could finally leave that park behind for good.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left> <He was hurled back to the park> <He thought this was the punishment for his failures>  <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun: lost the ball in twilight. didn't chase after it because he was drained by helplessness and loneliness.

The first drop of chlorhexidine hit his raw flesh.
There was no scream this time. No violent thrashing. Jarren Duran had no fight left.
His body went rigid, a single, prolonged spasm of agony, and his mind simply… broke. It fled the sterile room, fled the well-meaning faces of his protectors, and hurled itself back to the only place that could make sense of this level of suffering.
He was in the park. The sun was hot. The air was thick with the smell of cut grass and his own fear. His father stood on the mound, his face a mask of disappointment.
The searing pain in his hand was no longer antiseptic. It was the sting of a baseball, thrown not to be caught, but to punish. And his mind, lost in the feverish delirium, began to confess the sins that had earned him this penance.
Not swinging the best. The first ball hit him in the ribs. He gasped, the memory of the pain sharp and real.
Not growing up. The second one caught him on the thigh. A deep, throbbing ache. “Why aren’t you growing?” his father’s voice echoed in his head.
The pain intensified as the nurse’s swab moved across the wound. His mind, seeking a reason, latched onto his most profound professional failures.
The Tapia inside-the-park home run. He was back in center field, the sky a confusing twilight purple. The ball disappeared. He remembered the feeling—not of panic, but of a cold, hollow helplessness. He didn’t run. He just stood there, drained, empty, the roar of the crowd a distant, mocking wave. He remembered the walk back to the dugout, the burning shame, the terror of having to turn and look at the faces in the stands. The antiseptic’s fire was the burn of their thousands of accusing eyes.
Kansas City. The memory was a blur of sun and failure. A fly ball dropping. Then another. The jeers from the crowd. His own voice, raw and angry, shouting back. The shame of being sent down. The antiseptic was the sting of that demotion, the chemical burn of his own lost control.
The dropped liner. Bello was on the mound. An easy play. The ball hit his glove and fell out. The runner scored. The game was lost. He remembered Bello’s face, contorted in disbelief and fury. He remembered the roars echoing down the tunnel after the game. “Big dumb fuck! Incredible! You must be fucking kidding me!” Each word was a fresh wave of chemical fire on his hand. This was the punishment for letting his brother down.
The dive. A ball in the gap. He launched himself, felt the ball tick off his glove, and then tried to smother it with his body, a desperate, pathetic attempt that only pushed it further away. A double became a triple. The antiseptic was the burn of the turf, the shame of his own failed effort.
The strikeout. Bases loaded, eighth inning, the team clawing its way back. He swung through a slider in the dirt. The rally was dead. He was the reason.
Caught stealing. Raffy at the plate. A ball in the dirt. He should have been safe. He wasn’t. Raffy hit a double. He would have scored. He cost them the game.
Each memory was a fresh application of the antiseptic. Each failure was a justification for the pain. He was not in a trainer’s room being healed. He was at the center of his own personal hell, receiving the sentence for a lifetime of letting people down. He was finally getting what he had always deserved.
<Jarren began to apologize for those failures, his voice slurred>
<Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up, sometimes retreated to the grammar of his childhood>

The nurse continued her slow, methodical work, swabbing the raw flesh with the fiery antiseptic. Jarren, lost in his delirium, began to speak, his voice a slurred, ghostly whisper against Cora’s chest. He was confessing his sins to the faceless judge in his mind.
“...sorry… bat’s slow…” he murmured, his grammar shifting, becoming simpler, younger. “...not swingin’ good…”
Cora just held him, his own face a mask of agony. He was no longer just hearing the words; he was seeing the memories play out, a highlight reel of his player’s deepest shames.
“...I not growin’…” Jarren whispered, the words of a small boy apologizing for his own body. “...sorry, Dad…”
The antiseptic swab moved, and a fresh wave of pain brought a new confession.
“...the twilight… couldn’t see it…” he gasped. “...just stood there… so… so lonely out there…” He paused, his breathing hitched. “...didn’t wanna look at ‘em… the fans… didn’t wanna see their faces…”
I exchanged a look with Triston. The loneliness. The fear of the crowd’s judgment. It was a window into a private hell we never knew he inhabited.
“...KC… dropped two…” he mumbled, his voice thick with remembered shame. “...yelled at ‘em… I’m sorry… I’m a bad person…”
The nurse continued her work, relentless, necessary. The pain brought forth the memory of Bello’s fury.
“...the liner… Bello… he was so mad…” Jarren’s voice cracked. “...he right… big dumb fuck… that’s me…” He was accepting the insult, internalizing it as truth. “...shoulda caught it… sorry, Brayan…”
Then came the dive. The one where he’d tried to smother the ball.
“...Seager… hit it so hard…” he whispered. “...tried to stop it… with my body… shoulda stopped it…”
Triston, unable to stay silent, leaned in. “No, man,” he said, his voice a low, urgent rumble. “No. That was 110 off the bat. We were glad it missed you. You hear me? We were glad you were okay.”
But Jarren couldn’t hear him. He was lost in the memory of his failure, not the reality of his survival.
The antiseptic kept burning, dredging up more ghosts.
“...bases loaded… swung at dirt… sorry, guys…”
“...got thrown out… Raffy was up… shoulda stayed… sorry, Raffy…”
It was a litany of apology, a rosary of failure. He was purging every mistake, every moment he felt he had let someone down. He was a grown man speaking with the grammar of his childhood, his mind conflating every error on the field with the original sin of not being good enough. We were holding him down not just for a medical procedure, but for a forced exorcism of his own deepest insecurities. And the pain, we all knew, was only just beginning.
<Jarren began to apologize for those failures, his voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic being interviewed>
<sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid> <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun. Lack of hustle.> <Kansas City. Lost the game. ><The dropped liner. Bello got an L instead of W. not even a quality start> <The failed attempt of dive and smother (even though everyone else in the room thought it wasn't a good idea to smother a liner off Corey Seager's bat, exit velo 110+. Everyone else was relieved that the ball bounced past him.)> <The struckout which wasted the last rally> <caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> <add more details> <the antiseptic process: 2/5>
The nurse continued her work, her movements steady and methodical, oblivious to the psychodrama unfolding beneath her hands. The antiseptic kept flowing, and Jarren’s delirious confession continued, his voice a slurred, disjointed monologue that shifted disturbingly between timelines.
One moment, he was the professional athlete, giving a post-game press conference in hell.
“...unacceptable,” he murmured, his voice a weak imitation of his public self. “Lack of hustle on the Tapia ball. No excuse for it. I take full responsibility. Let the team down, let the city down.”
The next moment, the grammar would shift, the voice becoming smaller, younger.
“...I not swingin’ good,” he’d whisper, the words of a child trying to explain himself to an angry parent. “I try, Daddy. I try.”
Cora held him, his face a mask of agony, listening to the raw, unfiltered feed of his player’s deepest insecurities.
The antiseptic swab made another pass. A fresh wave of pain. A new memory surfaced.
“Kansas City…” he groaned, the professional athlete returning. “Can’t drop two balls like that. Inexcusable at this level. Lost my composure with the fans. That’s on me. I have to be better. More professional.”
Then, the child again, his voice small and pleading. “I didn’t mean to be bad. They was yellin’.”
The nurse paused to get more antiseptic. The brief respite was filled with the memory of Bello’s fury.
“The liner…” Jarren whispered, his voice full of adult shame. “That’s Bello’s win. I turned it into a loss. He didn’t even get a quality start because of me. That’s… that’s taking money out of his pocket. That’s messing with his career. Unforgivable.”
Triston, standing guard, winced. He knew the fierce loyalty between the pitchers and the defense. He was hearing the sacred trust being broken in Jarren’s mind.
The antiseptic returned. The pain flared.
“The dive…” he gasped. “Seager… off the bat…” He was trying to analyze the play, the professional breaking it down. “Shouldn’t have… shouldn’t have tried to smother it. Bad fundamentals.”
I looked at Triston, who shook his head slightly. We all remembered that play. A 110-mph missile off Seager’s bat. We had all been terrified he was going to break his wrist or his collarbone trying to stop it. We were relieved when it bounced past him. But in his mind, it was another failure of execution.
“The K…” he murmured, his voice growing weaker. “Bases loaded. Can’t happen. That’s the game right there. I lost the game.”
“The steal…” he whispered, his voice barely audible now. “Raffy… Raffy was hot. Shoulda let him hit. Bad baseball. I was being selfish. Trying to make something happen. Bad… bad teammate…”
He was deconstructing himself, piece by painful piece. Each memory was a sin, each sin deserving of this fiery penance. He wasn’t just confessing; he was agreeing with the punishment. He was validating it. And we, his protectors, were forced to hold him steady as he convicted himself.
<Jarren began to apologize for those failures, his voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic being interviewed>
<sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid> 
<Not swinging the best> 
<Not growing up. 5’4, 100 pounds going into high school>
<the Tapia inside the park homerun. Lack of hustle.> 
<Kansas City. Lost the game. >
<The dropped liner. Bello got an L instead of W. not even a quality start>

<The struckout which wasted the last rally> 
<caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> 
<add more details, write as long as you need> 
<the antiseptic process: 2/5>
The nurse continued her work, her movements steady and methodical, oblivious to the psychodrama unfolding in her hands. The antiseptic kept flowing, and Jarren’s confession continued, his voice a slurred, disjointed bridge between two worlds.
He was no longer just feeling the punishments; he was articulating them, his grammar and persona shifting with the memory.
“...my swing… it’s a process… just trying to stay through the ball…” he began, the words a hollow echo of a thousand post-game interviews. It was the voice of Jarren Duran, the professional athlete, explaining away a slump. But then the voice fractured, shrinking, becoming younger. “...not swinging best… sorry, Dad…”
The antiseptic swabbed a particularly sensitive area, and the memory shifted again.
“...just a late bloomer… always had to work harder…” The professional voice returned, trying to frame a narrative of perseverance. But the fire was too hot. The facade crumbled. “...five-four… hundred pounds… not my fault… I don’t know why I not growing…” The grammar of his childhood returned, the helpless plea of a boy being blamed for his own body.
Cora’s grip tightened, his knuckles white. He was hearing the secret pain behind the player he managed every day.
The nurse’s hand moved, and a new memory, a new sin, was brought to the surface.
“The Tapia homer,” he murmured, the professional voice again, distant and full of practiced regret. “There’s no excuse for a lack of hustle. I take full responsibility. I let the team down, I let the fans down.” Then, the voice broke, becoming raw, vulnerable. “...so tired… just wanted it to be over… didn’t wanna turn around… didn’t wanna see their faces…”
He was confessing not to a lack of hustle, but to a moment of profound emotional exhaustion, a truth he could never admit to a microphone.
“Kansas City,” he gasped, as another wave of chemical pain washed over him. “That’s on me. Lost my composure. Can’t let the fans get to you. That loss is on me.” The voice was flat, robotic, the voice of a man taking his medicine in a press conference.
The antiseptic found a new spot. A new failure.
“Bello… he pitched his heart out…” The professional voice, full of respect for his teammate. Then, the raw truth. “...shoulda had it… easy play… he got the L… not even a quality start… all my fault… he was so mad…” He wasn’t just remembering the error; he was reliving Bello’s rage, taking it on as his own deserved punishment.
Triston, standing by, winced. He remembered that day. He remembered Bello’s fury. He had seen it as a pitcher’s frustration. He now understood it as a scar on Jarren’s soul.
“The dive…” Jarren mumbled, his voice slurring badly now. “Seager… exit velo over a hundred… gotta make that play… gotta keep it in front of you…” He was reciting the coaching points, the fundamentals. But then his mind replayed the reality of it. The ball rocketing off the bat. His desperate, foolish attempt to smother it. “...stupid… coulda got hurt… stupid…”
I looked at Triston, who shook his head. We all knew it was a miracle he hadn’t been hurt on that play. We had been relieved. He had seen it as another failure of execution.
The nurse continued her relentless, healing work.
“Bases loaded… wasted it…”
“...bad jump… Raffy woulda drove me in…”
The litany went on, a highlight reel of his worst moments, each one assigned as a reason for the fire consuming his hand. He was trying to make it make sense, to find a logic for the illogical pain. He was putting himself on trial, confessing to every crime, and accepting the sentence, all while held in the arms of the men who were desperately trying to save him.
<He apologized, he pleaded, he promised, everything he said was about baseball> 
<His voice slurred>
<Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic talking to his coaches, manager and GM>
<sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid>
<He promised to swing the best> 
<to be bigger, stronger> 
<to act like All-Star MVP every night. A promise even Ohtani won’t make>
<to play 162 games. Even tonight. Tape it up. I can play defense, I can hit, I can run. > 
<to hustle more(other people’s reactions: how is that possible?)>
<to work harder. (other people’s reactions: given his work ethics, maybe he needs to stop sleeping and eating)> 
<add more details, write as long as you need> 
<the antiseptic process: 3/5>
The nurse paused to get a fresh swab, a momentary, blessed reprieve. But the fire didn’t need fresh fuel; it was a self-sustaining inferno now, feeding on the kindling of Jarren’s memories. His apologies and pleas continued, a desperate, delirious negotiation with the ghosts in his head.
His voice, slurred and unsteady, shifted between the man in the room and the boy in the park.
“...I’ll be better, skip,” he mumbled, the words directed at the fabric of Cora’s jacket. It was the voice of the professional player, talking to his manager. “I’ll get the swing right. Stay inside the ball. Use the whole field. I promise.” Then, the voice shrank, the grammar fraying. “...I swing best… I promise… no more strikeouts…”
The antiseptic returned, and with it, a new wave of agony and a new set of promises.
“...I’ll get bigger,” he gasped, the words a direct, heartbreaking response to the phantom voice in his head. “...work out more… get stronger… I promise, Dad…”
I looked at Triston, whose own massive frame seemed to shrink in the face of such a painful, impossible promise. Jarren was already a physical specimen, a marvel of speed and power. The idea that he felt he wasn’t big or strong enough was a window into a profound, lifelong dysmorphia.
The nurse’s swab moved again, and the promises grew more grandiose, more desperate.
“...the MVP… I’ll be that guy… every night,” he slurred, the voice of the athlete trying to bargain with his GM. “I’ll play like an All-Star MVP every single game. I promise.”
Cora just held him tighter, his face a mask of sorrow. It was a promise no one, not even Shohei Ohtani, could ever hope to keep. It was the promise of a man who believed his worth was tied to nightly perfection.
“...one-sixty-two…” he breathed, the words coming in ragged pants. “I can play 162. No days off. I’m good. Just… just tape it up.” His head tried to lift, his hazy eyes searching for me. “I can play tonight. I can play defense. I can hit. I can run. Put me in. Please. I can play.”
It was the most insane, heartbreaking thing he had said yet. Here he was, being physically and mentally dismantled, and his core programming was screaming at him to get back on the field, to prove his toughness, to earn his place.
The antiseptic continued its merciless work.
“...I’ll hustle more,” he promised to some unseen coach.
Triston let out a short, sharp, incredulous breath. More? How was that even possible? The man already played with a reckless abandon that terrified half the coaching staff. He played every routine groundball like it was the seventh game of the World Series.
“...I’ll work harder,” Jarren vowed, his voice fading to a whisper.
I shook my head slowly. The kid’s work ethic was already legendary. He was the first to arrive, the last to leave. He lived in the batting cage and the weight room. For him to “work harder” would mean abandoning sleep, abandoning food, abandoning the very act of being human.
He was promising to annihilate himself.
He was apologizing for every perceived failure, and in his delirium, he was offering to sacrifice his body, his health, his very sanity on the altar of baseball to atone for them. He was promising to become the perfect, indestructible baseball machine he had always been told he needed to be. And all we could do was hold him down and let the fire burn, praying that when it was over, the man would be left, and the machine would be gone.
<His voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic talking to his coaches, manager and GM>
<the promises became more frentic, as the fire burnt harder> <I’ll hit a leadoff homer. > <I’ll pull on a straight steal of home> <He make promises on hitting.>(Casas's reaction: Even Ted Williams can't do that) <He make promises on defense>(Craig's reaction:Even JBJ in his prime won't make such promise) <He make promises on base stealing>(Cora's reaction: Even Jackie Robinson will refuse to do so) <He swear he would do anything. Anything you ask. Just please let it stop.> <add more details, write as long as you need> <the antiseptic process: 4/5>
The nurse, her face a grim, stoic mask, continued her relentless work. The antiseptic fire was now at its peak, a searing, all-consuming agony. And as the pain intensified, Jarren’s promises grew more frantic, more impossible, a desperate auction of his own future in exchange for a moment’s peace.
He was no longer just promising to be better. He was promising to be a god.
“...leadoff homer…” he gasped, his head thrashing against Cora’s chest. “First pitch. I’ll hit it out. Every game. I promise, skip. I’ll get us the lead…”
The professional athlete was making a deal with his manager, offering up a fantasy of guaranteed, immediate success.
The swab moved, and the promise escalated into the realm of pure myth.
“...steal home…” he panted, his eyes squeezed shut. “Man on third… I’ll do it. Straight steal. I’ll be safe. I promise. I’ll get the run in…”
Cora just held on, his heart breaking. A straight steal of home was a once-in-a-career play, a moment of legendary audacity. Jarren was offering it up as a nightly sacrifice.
The fire burned hotter. The promises became a torrent of impossibility.
“...I’ll hit .400,” he slurred, the words tumbling out. “No, .500. I’ll never strike out again. I’ll hit a homer every time you need one. Just tell me when. I’ll do it. I promise.”
Triston Casas, still anchoring the arm, looked over at me, his eyes wide with a horrified disbelief. He was a student of hitting, a disciple of Ted Williams. He knew the absurdity of what Jarren was saying. He mouthed the words to me, a silent, incredulous commentary: Even Ted couldn’t do that.
The nurse, mercilessly, continued her work on the raw, weeping flesh. The focus of Jarren’s delirious bargaining shifted from the plate to the field.
“...no ball will drop,” he vowed, his voice cracking. “Nothing. Not in the gap, not over my head. I’ll catch everything. Everything they hit. I promise.”
I shook my head slowly, thinking of the defensive savants I had seen. I thought of Jackie Bradley Jr. in his absolute prime, his preternatural reads, his impossible closing speed. Even JBJ, a defensive god, would never dare make such a promise. The game is designed for failure. Jarren was promising to break the game itself.
The antiseptic found its final, untouched corners. The pain reached its crescendo.
“...I’ll steal second and third… every time…” he gasped, his body convulsing. “...never get caught… I’ll be faster… I promise…”
Cora, a student of the game’s history, a man who revered the legends, thought of the great Jackie Robinson, the man who revolutionized the art of baserunning through sheer intelligence and will. Even Jackie would have refused such a suicidal mandate. It was a promise to run into a buzzsaw.
Finally, the promises, the apologies, the bargaining—it all collapsed under the sheer, overwhelming weight of the agony. The athlete, the son, the professional—they all dissolved, leaving only a raw, pleading human being.
He twisted his head, his unfocused eyes searching for any of us, for all of us.
“Anything,” he sobbed, the word a final, desperate surrender. “I’ll do anything. Anything you ask. Just… please… make it stop. Please…”
It was the cry of a man who had offered up his past, his present, and his future. He had nothing left to give. He had finally reached the end of his promises. He had reached the end of himself.
<Sorry I let you down. Just want you to know I’ve tried my best> <Jarren finally gave up on negotiations> <He just endured it, fully accepted his punishment, more convinced than ever he deserved that.> <The angry god wouldn’t stop until he was thoroughly chastened, until the lesson was burned into him> <He sobbed into Cora’s shoulders. Like a broken rag doll><In his mind, the only way to redeem himself is by taking the punishment> <add more details, write as long as you need> <the antiseptic finally ends>
The final, desperate plea—“please… make it stop”—hung in the air, a testament to a spirit pushed beyond its absolute limit. But the fire did not stop. The nurse, her duty absolute, continued her methodical, cleansing work.
And in that moment, something inside Jarren shifted. The frantic bargaining ceased. The impossible promises died on his lips. The desperate negotiations with the ghosts of his past went silent.
He gave up.
It was not a surrender to us, or to the pain. It was a surrender to the narrative that had governed his entire life. He had tried to be better. He had promised to be perfect. And still, the punishment continued. The only logical conclusion left in his shattered, delirious mind was that this was not a negotiation at all. It was a sentence. And it was just.
His body, which had been a live wire of agony, went strangely still. He was no longer fighting the pain. He was accepting it. He sagged completely against Cora, a broken rag doll, his head lolling to the side. His eyes, half-lidded, stared at nothing, but they were no longer wild with terror. They were filled with a profound, hollow resignation.
A final, quiet murmur escaped his lips, not to us, but to the universe, to the angry god in the park.
“...sorry I let you down…” he whispered, his voice a thread of sound. “...just want you to know… I tried my best…”
It was a final, heartbreaking apology. The apology of a son who had done everything his father had asked—endured the pain, come back for more, pushed himself to the breaking point—and had still been found wanting.
He was now fully convinced that he deserved this. Every searing wave of the antiseptic was a righteous punishment for his failures. The angry god of his childhood would not be appeased by promises. He would only be satisfied when Jarren was thoroughly chastened, when the lesson was not just learned, but burned into his very flesh, a permanent scar on his body to match the one on his soul.
He just endured. The tremors that wracked his body were no longer from resistance, but from the pure, physical shock of the agony. He sobbed quietly into Cora’s shoulder, not with the desperation of before, but with the quiet, hopeless grief of a man who has finally accepted his damnation. In his mind, this was the only path to redemption. To take the punishment without complaint, to prove, in this final, ultimate test, that he was strong enough to absorb the full weight of his own unworthiness.
Cora held him, his own face a mask of silent, furious grief. He was no longer just comforting a player; he was shielding a son from a god he couldn’t see, a helpless mortal in the face of a cruel, invisible force. Triston and I stood our ground, our grips unwavering, our faces grim. We were no longer just holding him down. We were anchors, the only things keeping him tethered to this world while his mind was being flayed in another.
And then, with an almost imperceptible finality, the nurse pulled the swab away for the last time. She capped the bottle of chlorhexidine.
The sound of the plastic cap clicking shut was the loudest thing I had ever heard.
It was over.
The fire was out. The punishment was complete. The room was filled with a deafening silence, broken only by the quiet, broken sobs of a young man who had just walked through hell and back, and was more convinced than ever that it was the place he belonged.
<Cora held Jarren in his arms as doctors applied ointment and bandage> <As agony subsided to ache, in the feverish state, Jarren began apologizing again, frantic to show that he had learned his lesson, in case the angry god want to give him a few more lightning strikes for good measure > <He was afraid that this may be just a break, a warm up before the real punishment ><He was desperate to convince the god that he had no defiance left, he was thoroughly chastened, he had taken his medicine. no further punishment was needed on this subject> <Cora gently but firmly told him it was over, it was not a punishment, it was healing> <add more details. Write as long as you need><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
The silence that followed the end of the antiseptic was a fragile, sacred thing. Jarren lay limp in Cora’s arms, a marionette with its strings cut, his body still trembling with the memory of the fire. The only sound was his quiet, exhausted weeping.
Dr. Adams and the nurse moved with a new, gentle efficiency. The time for brutal necessity was over; now was the time for comfort. The doctor began to apply a thick, cooling layer of silver sulfadiazine cream—a burn cream, not just a simple antibiotic—to the angry, brutalized wound. It was a balm, a promise of relief.
As the cool ointment began to soothe the searing agony, pulling it back from an inferno to a deep, throbbing ache, Jarren’s consciousness began to flicker back to life. The fever and the trauma still held him in their grip, but a sliver of awareness returned. And with it, a new and more insidious kind of terror.
He had survived the punishment. But what if it wasn’t over? What if this was just a break? A warm-up before the real punishment began?
The thought sent a fresh wave of panic through his exhausted system. He had to show that he’d learned his lesson. He had to prove that he was thoroughly chastened, that he had accepted his sentence. He had to convince the angry god in the park that no more lightning strikes were needed.
He began to apologize again, his voice a frantic, slurred whisper against Cora’s chest.
“...I’m sorry… I get it now… I get it…” he mumbled, his words tumbling over each other. “...no more excuses… I’ll be better… I promise…”
He was desperate to show his compliance, to prove that he had no defiance left.
“...the hustle… I’ll run harder… the swing… I’ll fix it… the defense… I won’t drop another ball… ever…”
He was trying to preemptively offer up sacrifices to ward off the next wave of pain. He was a prisoner, beaten and broken, now frantically trying to please his captor to avoid another session of torture.
“...I took it… I took my medicine…” he pleaded to the air. “...I learned… I’m sorry… please… no more…”
Cora, his heart shattering into a million pieces, tightened his embrace. He had to pull him out of this loop. He had to rewrite the narrative that was playing out in Jarren’s fevered mind.
He pulled back just enough to look Jarren in the eye, his own gaze firm, intense, and filled with a powerful, loving authority.
“Jarren. Listen to me,” he said, his voice a low, commanding rumble that demanded to be heard through the fog. “There is no god in this room. There is no punishment. There is no park.”
He paused, letting the words sink in.
“That fire… that was not a punishment. That was medicine. That was us, all of us, fighting an infection that was trying to hurt you. That was healing.”
Jarren stared at him, his eyes wide with confusion. The concept was too foreign. Pain was punishment. It had always been punishment.
“No…” he whispered. “I was… I was bad…”
“No,” Cora said, his voice gentle but absolute, refusing to let the old narrative take hold. “You were hurt. And we were making you better. The pain had a purpose, and that purpose is over. It is done. There is no more coming. This is the end of it.”
He leaned his forehead against Jarren’s again, a gesture of profound intimacy and truth.
“It’s over, mijo,” he whispered. “The lesson isn’t that you have to be better. The lesson is that you have to let us help you. And you did. You were brave enough to let us help you. Now it’s time to heal. The punishment is over, because it was never a punishment to begin with.”
He held him there, trying to will his own conviction, his own truth, into Jarren’s fractured soul, hoping to replace the voice of the angry father with the voice of a loving one.

<Jarren understood that it was over, at least for now> <But he got confused why this wasn’t a punishment. He failed everyone, it served him right.> <Another emergency flashed in Jarren’s mind: to avoid such punishment in foreseeable future. If possible, forever.> <Jarren turned to another currency he knew: promise. He promised the unthinkable and unachievable, to please the god at all cost, to avoid future punishments at all cost, to convince the god there would never be any need to repeat this lesson> <Cora assured him that he is good enough, he has been good enough, he has proven himself> <add more details. write as long as you need.><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
Cora’s words, delivered with such absolute, loving conviction, began to penetrate the feverish haze. “It’s over.”
The message landed. Jarren’s trembling body stilled. The immediate, visceral fear of another imminent assault began to recede. He understood, on some primal level, that the physical torture was finished, at least for now.
But his mind, steeped in a lifetime of conditional worth, couldn’t process the second part of Cora’s message. “It was never a punishment.”
He looked at Cora, his eyes filled with a deep, profound confusion. If this wasn’t a punishment, what was it? He had failed. He had dropped balls, struck out, gotten caught stealing. He had let his team down, his manager, his father. A failure of that magnitude demanded punishment. It was the natural order of his universe. The pain was the price. Cora’s words didn’t compute. It was like being told gravity no longer existed.
As the doctor gently wrapped his hand in a thick, protective layer of white gauze, a new, urgent crisis ignited in Jarren’s mind. The immediate threat was gone, but the memory of it was seared into his soul. He had to ensure this never, ever happened again. He had to find a way to appease the angry god permanently.
He had only one currency he knew that worked in that economy: promises.
He turned his head on Cora’s shoulder, his hazy eyes finding me, then Triston, then the doctor. He had to make us all understand. He had to make a new vow, a sacred, unbreakable oath.
“Okay,” he whispered, his voice a hoarse, desperate rasp. “Okay. I get it.”
He took a shuddering breath, gathering the last of his energy for this final, crucial negotiation.
“No more,” he vowed, his voice gaining a frantic, feverish strength. “I’ll be perfect. I promise. I will never make another mistake. Ever.”
He was looking at me now, the GM, the ultimate authority. “I’ll bat a thousand. I’ll hit a homer every at-bat. I’ll have a hundred stolen bases and never get caught. I will be perfect.”
He was offering the impossible, the unthinkable. He was promising to transcend the very nature of the sport, to eliminate failure from his game entirely.
“The defense…” he continued, his gaze shifting to Cora. “I’ll catch everything. Nothing will ever touch the grass again. I promise, skip. Nothing.”
He was trying to convince the gods of baseball that there would never be a need for this lesson again, because he would never again be unworthy. He was trying to avoid future punishment at all costs.
Cora’s heart broke all over again. He had stopped the immediate fear, only to unleash a deeper, more insidious one.
He pulled Jarren’s head back to his chest, trying to quiet the frantic promises.
“Jarren, stop,” he said, his voice firm but gentle. “Listen to me. You don’t have to be perfect. We don’t want you to be perfect. It’s impossible.”
He held him tighter, trying to force the truth through the delirium.
“You are already good enough,” Cora said, his voice thick with emotion. “Do you hear me? You were good enough yesterday. You are good enough today, right now, in this bed. You were good enough when you were a little kid in that park. You have always been good enough.”
He pulled back to look him in the eye again. “You have nothing to prove to us. You have already proven yourself a thousand times over. Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is to be healthy. That’s it. That’s the only promise we need from you.”
Jarren just stared at him, his mind a whirlwind of conflicting truths. The promise of unconditional acceptance warring with a lifetime of conditional love. He didn’t know what to believe. He just knew he never wanted to feel that fire again.
<Jarren understood that it was over, at least for now> <But he got confused why this wasn’t a punishment. He failed everyone, it served him right.> <Another emergency flashed in Jarren’s mind: to avoid such punishment in foreseeable future. If possible, forever.> <Jarren turned to another currency he knew: promise. He promised the unthinkable and unachievable, to please the god at all cost, to avoid future punishments at all cost, to convince the god there would never be any need to repeat this lesson> <He summoned all his remaining strength for the most important negotiation of his life><clinging to Cora as desperate as a drowning man><Cora assured him that he is good enough, he has been good enough, he has proven himself> <add more details. write as long as you need.><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
Cora’s words, delivered with such absolute, loving conviction, began to penetrate the feverish haze. “It’s over.”
The message landed. Jarren’s trembling body stilled. The immediate, visceral fear of another imminent assault began to recede. He was safe, at least for now.
But as the terror subsided, a profound confusion took its place. He looked at Cora, his brow furrowed, his mind struggling to reconcile two opposing truths.
It wasn’t a punishment?
The idea was nonsensical. He had failed. He had dropped the ball in Kansas City. He had let Bello down. He had been caught stealing. He hadn’t grown. He hadn’t swung the best. The evidence was a mountain, the verdict self-evident. The pain was the just and logical consequence. If it wasn’t a punishment, what was it? The world, which had operated on a clear, brutal set of rules his entire life, suddenly made no sense.
And in that confusion, a new, desperate emergency flashed in his mind. If this agony was not the required penance for his past sins, then it was something that could happen again, for any reason, at any time. He had to prevent that. He had to avoid this hell forever.
He had only one currency left to bargain with. The one he had been taught since he was five years old.
Promises.
He summoned every last scrap of energy from his depleted system. This was the most important negotiation of his life. He had to convince the gods—the ones in this room and the one in his head—that there would never, ever be a need to repeat this lesson. He had to offer a sacrifice so great, so absolute, that it would guarantee his future safety.
He clung to Cora’s jacket, his grip as desperate as a drowning man’s. His eyes, though still hazy, burned with a new, frantic intensity.
“Okay,” he whispered, his voice a raw, pleading rasp. “Okay. I get it. No more. I’ll make sure.”
He began to speak, the words a torrent of impossible, soul-crushing vows.
“I’ll be perfect,” he promised, his voice gaining a feverish strength. “From now on. Perfect. No more errors. No more strikeouts on bad pitches. No more bad jumps. I’ll get a hit every time. I’ll score every time. I’ll win the game every night. I promise you. I will be perfect.”
He was offering up his own humanity.
“You’ll never have to do this again,” he pleaded, his eyes darting between us. “There will be no reason. I won’t give you a reason. I will be the best player in baseball. I will be the best son. I will be what you want me to be. I promise.”
He was trying to build a fortress of perfection around himself, believing it was the only way to keep the pain at bay.
Cora’s heart broke. He saw the flawed, tragic logic. He saw the boy trying to bargain his way out of the park forever. He pulled him tighter, trying to physically stop the frantic promises.
“Jarren, stop,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “Listen to me. We don’t want you to be perfect.”
Jarren just shook his head, the words tumbling out faster. “No, I can do it! I can—”
“NO!” Cora’s voice was a firm but gentle thunderclap that finally silenced him. He held Jarren’s face in his hands again, forcing him to listen.
“You don’t have to be perfect,” Cora said, his voice dropping to an intense, loving whisper. “We don’t want you to be perfect. The game is built on failure. Being a human is built on failure. It’s okay to fail.”
He leaned his forehead against Jarren’s again.
“You are already enough,” he said, the words slow, deliberate, a sacred vow. “Right now. In this bed. Broken and hurting. You are enough. You were enough yesterday. You will be enough tomorrow. You don’t have to promise us anything.”
He pulled back, his eyes boring into Jarren’s.
“You have already proven yourself. You are a Major League All-Star. You are a pennant winner. You are one of the best players in the world. The negotiation is over, because you already won. You have nothing left to prove to us. You have nothing left to prove to anyone.”
He paused, his voice dropping to a whisper.
“You just have to prove it to yourself.”
<The old JD is still suspicious, but some part of him began to understand. A faint hope in his eyes.> <Jarren cried himself to sleep in Cora's arms. More relief this time.> <add more details, write as long as you need> 
Cora’s words, a direct assault on the foundational beliefs of Jarren’s entire existence, hung in the quiet room. “You are already enough.”
Jarren stared at him, his fever-bright eyes a swirling mix of confusion, disbelief, and a desperate, terrifying hope. The old Jarren, the boy from the park, was still there, whispering poison in his ear. It’s a trick. It’s a test. Don’t believe him. They’ll punish you later if you let your guard down.
But another part of him, a part that had been starved and silent for twenty-five years, was listening. It was the part of him that had always known, on some deep, instinctual level, that the rules of his world were wrong. It was the part that had cried out, “It’s not my fault,” when his father had demanded to know why he wasn’t growing.
He looked from Cora’s unwavering, loving gaze to my steady, affirming nod. He saw Triston, his massive teammate, looking at him not with judgment, but with a profound, brotherly respect. He was surrounded by a truth that was so powerful, so unified, it was becoming harder and harder to deny.
Could it be true? Could the love, the acceptance, not be conditional? Could he fail, and still be… enough?
The internal war was visible on his face. His brow furrowed. His lips parted as if to argue, to make one more promise, but no words came out. The old programming was fighting against this radical new data, and his exhausted mind couldn’t reconcile the conflict.
And then, something inside him let go.
It wasn’t a conscious decision. It was a surrender of a different kind. Not the surrender to punishment, but the surrender to a possibility he had never allowed himself to entertain. The possibility that he was safe.
A single, fat tear welled up and rolled down his cheek. But this tear was different from all the others that had been shed in this room. It wasn’t born of pain, or fear, or shame.
It was born of relief.
His body, which had been coiled in a state of perpetual negotiation, finally went slack. The last vestiges of tension drained away, leaving only a bone-deep, profound exhaustion. The fight was truly over.
He sagged against Cora, his head finding its familiar place on his manager’s chest. He didn’t speak. He didn’t need to. His body spoke for him.
He began to cry again, but the sound was soft, quiet, almost peaceful. It was the sound of a prisoner, having been told his life sentence has been commuted, finally allowing himself to believe it might be true. It was the sound of a dam not breaking, but being carefully, lovingly dismantled, allowing the river to finally flow where it was always meant to go.
Cora held him, rocking him gently, murmuring quiet reassurances. He was no longer trying to contain a storm. He was simply sheltering a child who had finally found his way home.
I watched them, my own eyes burning. This was the moment. This was the pivot point. The old Jarren was still there, suspicious and scared, but a new one was being born, right here, in the quiet of this room, nurtured by a radical act of grace.
Within minutes, the quiet sobs faded into the deep, even breaths of sleep. He had cried himself into a state of pure, unadulterated exhaustion, his mind and body finally succumbing to the healing peace it had been so desperately denied. He was asleep in his manager’s arms, a faint, hopeful light beginning to dawn in the long, dark night of his soul.

Throughout the entire ordeal, Dr. Adams and the two nurses had been a study in professional detachment. They were the mechanics, focused solely on the broken machine, their faces grimly determined as they navigated the chaos to complete their critical task. They had seen pain before. They had dealt with difficult, panicked patients. It was part of the job.
But now, as Jarren slept peacefully in Cora’s arms, the job was over. And for the first time, they had a moment to process what they had just witnessed.
They stood together near the doorway, quietly cleaning and packing their equipment, their movements slow and thoughtful. The adrenaline had faded, leaving a heavy, contemplative silence in its wake. They were no longer just mechanics; they were human beings who had been unwilling spectators to a profound human drama.
The younger nurse, her hands still trembling slightly as she sealed a biohazard bag, was the first to speak, her voice a hushed whisper.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” she said, shaking her head in disbelief. “The way he fought… and then the things he was saying…”
Dr. Adams, a man with twenty years of experience in sports medicine, leaned against a counter, pulling off his latex gloves with a weary snap. He stared at the sleeping player, his clinical gaze replaced by something far more complex.
“Toughness,” he said, his voice low and full of a new, profound respect. “We use that word all the time in this business. We think it means playing through a sprain, or taking a fastball off the ribs and staying in the game. We had no idea what it meant.”
He looked at me, his eyes searching for some kind of understanding. “Craig, the pain from that debridement, especially the second one on inflamed tissue… it’s extraordinary. We’d normally have a patient under conscious sedation for something half that severe. He took it all raw. The amount of willpower required to endure that, let alone to fight through it with that kind of strength… it’s off the charts. It’s a physiological miracle.”
The other nurse, an older, more seasoned woman, nodded in agreement. She was wiping down the now-empty instrument tray, but her eyes were on Jarren.
“It wasn’t just the toughness,” she said, her voice soft but clear. “It was the trauma. They were happening at the same time. It was like… like his strength and his pain were at war with each other inside his own body.” She paused, her hands stilling. “The things he was saying… about being sorry for not growing, for dropping a ball… my God. That’s not a ballplayer. That’s a child who has been hurt very, very badly.”
Dr. Adams ran a hand over his tired face. The full picture was settling in for him, the pieces clicking together into a disturbing and awe-inspiring mosaic.
“How?” he murmured, more to himself than to anyone else. “How does a person carry that? Every day. How do you walk into a clubhouse, face the media, stand in a batter’s box with a hundred thousand people screaming, and compete at the highest level in the world, while all of that is running in the background?”
He looked at Jarren, no longer seeing just a patient or an athlete, but a marvel of human resilience.
“We talk about the five tools of a baseball player,” Dr. Adams said, his voice filled with a quiet wonder. “We’ve been missing one. The sixth tool: the capacity to carry an impossible burden. And his is the best I’ve ever seen.”
He pushed off the counter, his duty as a doctor returning, but forever changed. “We’ll keep a close watch on him. But the infection… that might be the easiest part of this to heal.”
They finished their work in silence, the clinking of their tools a soft, respectful counterpoint to the quiet breathing from the bed. They had come into the room to treat a wound. They were leaving having witnessed a crucifixion and, just maybe, the beginning of a resurrection. They had seen the full, terrifying, and beautiful truth of the man who played left field. And they would never look at him, or the word “toughness,” the same way again.

After the medical team departed, a profound and heavy silence settled over the room, broken only by the soft, rhythmic beep of the monitor and the deep, peaceful breaths of the sleeping man in the bed. The three of us who remained—Cora, Casas, and I—were left in the quiet aftermath, each processing the cataclysm we had just endured.
We were no longer manager, player, and GM. We were just three men who had stood on the shore and watched a friend get swept out to sea by a tidal wave, and had somehow, against all odds, managed to pull him back.
Triston was the first to move. He had been leaning against the far wall, a silent, massive sentinel. He now pushed himself off it and walked slowly toward the bed. He stood there for a long moment, looking down at Jarren’s sleeping face. The pale, tear-streaked cheeks, the peaceful brow—it was a world away from the wild, tormented mask of agony from just an hour before.
“I don’t get it,” Triston said, his voice a low, bewildered rumble. He wasn’t speaking to us, but to the universe. “I… I get mad when I strike out. I break a bat sometimes. But that… what he has inside him… the things he was saying…”
He looked at Cora, his eyes wide with a new, almost fearful respect for his teammate. “He thinks he let us down? He thinks he’s not good enough? The guy plays harder than any ten guys I know. He’s the best athlete on this team. How can he not see that?”
Cora, who was sitting in the chair by the bed, his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, looked up. His own eyes were red-rimmed and weary.
“Because no one ever told him,” Alex said, his voice raspy with exhaustion and emotion. “They told him he had to be tougher, bigger, better. No one ever just told him he was enough. We didn’t even tell him. We just praised him for running through walls, we never asked why he felt he had to.”
He scrubbed a hand over his face, a gesture of profound self-recrimination. “I’m his manager. I’m supposed to know my players. I knew he was hard on himself. I had no idea… I had no idea it was this deep. The park… God, the things he said…” He trailed off, unable to give voice to the full horror of it.
I had remained standing, my arms crossed, a silent observer to this shared processing. My own mind was a whirlwind. The abstract knowledge given to me by the young woman had been made terrifyingly, viscerally real. I had seen the data points of her story become flesh and blood, screams and tears.
“We saw the symptoms,” I said, my voice quiet but clear, drawing their attention. “We saw the burnout in ’24. We saw the frustration. We saw the injuries. We saw the player who was always trying to do too much. But we were looking at the ‘what.’ We never understood the ‘why.’”
I walked over and stood beside Triston, looking down at Jarren.
“The ‘why’ is a childhood of being told your value is conditional,” I continued. “The ‘why’ is a belief that pain is the price of failure, and that love is the reward for enduring it. He wasn’t just playing baseball. He was in a constant, desperate negotiation for his own self-worth every single time he stepped on the field.”
Triston shook his head, his expression one of dawning, horrified comprehension. “So every time he makes an error… he thinks he’s that kid in the park again.”
“Exactly,” Cora said, his voice heavy. “And every time he plays through pain, he thinks he’s earning his father’s approval.”
We stood there in silence for another long moment, the three of us forming a protective circle around the bed. We were three vastly different men from different parts of the baseball hierarchy, but in that moment, we were united by a single, solemn, unspoken vow.
It was Triston who finally put it into words.
“Never again,” he said, his voice a low, fierce growl. “I’m never letting him get to that place again. I don’t care if he’s 0-for-20. I don’t care if he makes an error. I’m going to be the first one there telling him it’s okay. We’re good. We’ve got his back.”
Cora nodded, his eyes filled with a renewed, fiery determination. “It’s on all of us. In the dugout, in the clubhouse, on the field. We have to be the voices that drown out the other one. We have to build a new reality for him.”
I looked at them both—the young, compassionate giant and the wise, paternal manager. The fortress we needed to build around Jarren wasn’t just my responsibility. It was already being constructed, right here, in the hearts of the men who called him their teammate and their player.
“The old deal is over,” I said, my voice firm, sealing the pact. “From this day forward, his only job is to be Jarren Duran. Our job is to make sure he knows that’s more than enough.”
<Casas was confused about the repeat mention of "park, hit, throw baseballs, go back"><Cora and Craig explained everything to him><add more details. write as long as you need>
A heavy silence settled in the room again, punctuated by the steady rhythm of the medical monitor. Triston, his massive frame seeming to fill the small space, was still staring at Jarren, his brow furrowed in deep, troubled thought. He was replaying the delirious, heartbreaking confessions, trying to make sense of the fragments.
“I get most of it,” he said finally, his voice a low rumble. He looked from me to Cora. “The stuff about the games, the errors… I get being hard on yourself. But… what was all that other stuff? The stuff that sounded… younger.”
He paused, trying to recall the exact words. “‘Go back to the park’… ‘I promise I’ll get a hit’… He kept saying that. And the thing about his dad. What was that about?”
Cora and I exchanged a look. It was a heavy, knowing glance. We had been given the key to understanding Jarren’s trauma. Triston had only witnessed the raw, confusing symptoms. He was a part of the circle now, a key pillar in the new support system. He had a right to know. He needed to know.
I nodded at Cora. You should tell him. It will mean more coming from you.
Cora took a deep, weary breath and scrubbed a hand over his face. He motioned for Triston to take the chair I had been sitting in earlier. Triston pulled it closer, his posture leaning in, attentive.
“Tris,” Cora began, his voice low and grave. “What you heard in here… it’s not just about baseball. To understand Jarren, you have to understand where he comes from. You have to understand his relationship with his father.”
He proceeded to tell him the story, the one I had told him, the one the young woman had told me. He spoke of Octavio, the mountain of a man, and little Jarren, always trailing behind. He described the immense love, but also the immense, crushing pressure. He talked about the constant push to be bigger, stronger, better.
Triston listened, his expression shifting from confusion to a dawning, horrified comprehension. He was a big man himself, a top prospect who had likely been praised for his size and strength his whole life. The idea of a father yelling at his son for not growing was a foreign, cruel concept.
Then Cora got to the park.
“His dad coached him,” Cora said, his voice dropping even lower. “Hard. When Jarren was just a little kid, his dad would take him to a park for batting practice. And if Jarren wasn’t swinging right, if he wasn’t perfect… his dad would get angry.”
Cora paused, his own voice catching. He looked at Triston, his eyes filled with a pained gravity.
“He wouldn’t just yell, Tris. He’d throw the baseballs at him. To hit him. He’d peg his own son with baseballs and yell at him to be better.”
Triston’s face went slack. The color drained from it. “What?” he breathed, the word a puff of air. “He… he did what?”
“And the worst part,” Cora continued, his voice heavy with the tragedy of it, “is that Jarren would run home crying. But he’d always go back. He couldn’t stand to fail. He’d go back to the park, and his dad would be waiting for him, and he’d say, ‘I knew you’d come back.’ He taught him, he programmed him, to believe that enduring pain and returning for more was how you earned love.”
The pieces clicked into place for Triston. His eyes widened as he looked at the sleeping man in the bed. The delirious cries suddenly made a terrible, perfect sense.
“No more! I be better! Daddy!”
“Go back to the park… Daddy’s waiting…”
“So when he was in here,” Triston said, his voice a horrified whisper, “when the pain from that… that antiseptic got to be too much… he thought…”
“He thought he was back in the park,” I finished for him, my voice quiet. “He thought the pain was the punishment for his failures. He thought we were his father, and he was the child who had to endure it to prove he was worthy. He was begging us to stop, promising to be better, just like he did when he was a little boy.”
Triston sagged back in his chair, the full weight of the revelation crushing him. He looked at Jarren, no longer seeing just his fiery, hard-charging teammate. He was seeing a little boy, standing alone in a park, dodging baseballs thrown by the person who was supposed to protect him.
“My God,” Triston whispered, shaking his head slowly. “All this time… he’s been carrying that. Every single day.”
He looked at us, his eyes filled with a new, fierce, protective fire.
“Okay,” he said, his voice low but firm. “I get it now.”
He understood. He was no longer just a concerned teammate. He was a guardian of a sacred, painful secret. He was another wall in the fortress. And he would never look at Jarren Duran the same way again.

The long night bled into a new day. The fever, having raged and peaked, finally broke with the morning sun. I was dozing in my chair when I became aware of a change in the room’s rhythm. The frantic, shallow breaths from the bed had been replaced by a slow, deep, peaceful cadence.
I opened my eyes. Cora was already awake, watching, a hopeful, weary look on his face. Triston was asleep in his chair, his massive frame slumped in exhaustion.
On the bed, Jarren stirred. His eyes fluttered open. They were no longer wild with fever or clouded with delirium. They were clear. Tired, deeply bruised, but clear. He blinked slowly, taking in the quiet room, the morning light, the faces of the men who had kept watch.
He didn’t speak. He was trying to piece together the fragments of a nightmare.
He remembered the dive. The searing pain in his hand. The trainer’s room. The argument with Casas. The glint of metal instruments. It was a chaotic, terrifying slideshow in his mind.
He remembered… losing it. A vague, deeply shameful memory of screaming, of fighting. He remembered the feeling of being held down, the sensation of a fire being poured onto his hand. He remembered a profound, soul-deep terror. He knew, with a certainty that made his stomach clench, that he had messed up. Badly. He had broken down, shown a weakness he had sworn no one would ever see.
But the memory that followed was… confusing. He remembered Cora’s voice. Not angry, not disappointed. It was a low, soothing rumble, a shield against the chaos. He remembered the feeling of his head pressed against his manager’s shoulder, the solidness of it, the feeling of being held not in restraint, but in an embrace. He had a vague recollection of me and Triston, not as accusers, but as anchors. He had messed up, but somehow, inexplicably, Cora had gotten him off the hook. The punishment he was sure was coming had never arrived.
He looked down at his hand. It was swaddled in a thick, clean white bandage. It throbbed with a deep, profound ache, a universe away from the searing agony of the night before. The fire was gone.
He remembered the pain. He would never forget the pain. But more clearly, more vividly, he remembered the warmth. He remembered the pressure of Cora’s arms around him, a human fortress. He remembered the steady weight of Triston’s hands on his arm, an unbreakable anchor. He remembered the constant, rhythmic circles of my hand on his back, a grounding, silent presence.
He had been in hell, but for the first time in his life, he hadn’t been there alone.
A strange, unfamiliar feeling began to settle over him. He tried to identify it. It wasn’t relief, not yet. It was… lightness.
He had spent his entire life carrying a massive, invisible weight on his shoulders. The weight of expectation. The weight of perfection. The weight of having to be the toughest, the strongest, the one who never quit. Last night, he had failed in every conceivable way. He had quit. He had broken. He had cried for his father. He had shown them the absolute worst, most vulnerable parts of himself.
And the world hadn’t ended. The sky hadn’t fallen. The people he respected most hadn’t abandoned him. They had… held him.
He looked at Cora, who offered a small, tired, gentle smile. He looked at me, and I gave him a slow, affirming nod. He looked at the sleeping giant in the other chair, a teammate who had seen his utter collapse and had stayed.
The heavy burden, the one he had carried since he was a small boy in a park, felt… different. It was still there, a part of his history, a part of his soul. But it felt a little lighter. As if, in the night, the three men in this room had each silently, without asking, reached out and taken a corner of it, helping him bear the load.
He sank back into the pillow, a deep, shuddering sigh escaping his lips. The shame was still there, a faint echo in the back of his mind. But for the first time, it was being overshadowed by something else. Something new and fragile and powerful.
He felt safe.

An hour later, after a breakfast of broth and Gatorade that he’d accepted without argument, the door opened again. It was Dr. Adams and the younger nurse, making their morning rounds. Their steps were hesitant, their expressions a mixture of professional duty and genuine trepidation. They looked like zookeepers entering the enclosure of a lion they weren’t entirely sure was still tranquilized.
A sports recap was playing softly on the small TV mounted on the wall. As the doctors entered, Jarren, with a newfound, quiet consideration, reached for the remote on the bedside table to mute the volume.
The effect was instantaneous and comical.
Dr. Adams, who was halfway into the room, froze mid-stride, his hand half-raised. The nurse, who was right behind him, let out a tiny, involuntary squeak and took a half-step back, her eyes wide. They stared at Jarren’s outstretched hand as if he were reaching for a weapon. Their bodies tensed, bracing for another explosion, another hurled pitcher, another primal roar.
Jarren stopped, his hand hovering over the remote. He looked at them, his brow furrowed in confusion. Why were they looking at him like that? He was just turning down the TV. He looked at us, a silent question in his eyes.
The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. And then, Triston Casas started to laugh.
It wasn’t a loud laugh. It started as a low chuckle, a rumble in his massive chest, and then grew into a full, deep, infectious laugh that filled the entire room. He leaned back in his chair and slapped his knee.
“Oh, man,” he wheezed, wiping a tear from his eye. “You guys should see your faces.”
Cora caught on immediately. A wide, weary grin spread across his face. He shook his head, the tension of the last 36 hours finally breaking. “Doc,” he said, his voice full of mirth. “I think it’s safe. He’s just going for the remote. I don’t think he can throw it that hard anyway.”
I couldn’t help but smile myself. The absurdity of the scene was a much-needed pressure valve. I looked at the two terrified medical professionals and then at the utterly bewildered player in the bed.
“Careful, Doctor,” I said, my voice laced with a dry humor. “That’s a world-class athlete you’re dealing with. The hand-eye coordination is off the charts. And his remote-to-wall exit velocity is probably in the 99th percentile.”
Jarren just stared at us, his confusion deepening. “What… what are you guys talking about?”
Triston finally caught his breath. “Bro,” he said, pointing a thumb at the doctor. “Yesterday, you almost gave that man a haircut with a water pitcher. You turned into the Incredible Hulk. They think you’re gonna go nuclear on them again.”
A faint flush crept up Jarren’s neck. The memory was a hazy, shameful blur, but he knew something had happened. “I… I did that?”
“You did that and then some,” Cora chuckled, getting up and patting the doctor on the shoulder. “It’s okay, Doc. The animal is fed. He’s calm. You can approach the cage.”
Dr. Adams let out a shaky breath, a nervous smile finally breaking through his professional terror. “Right,” he said, cautiously taking another step into the room. “Of course.”
The nurse still looked unconvinced.
The shared laughter, the gentle ribbing, it was a gift. It took the terrifying, shameful memory of his breakdown and reframed it. It wasn’t a monstrous secret we would never speak of again. It was now a story. A slightly terrifying, but ultimately funny story about the time Jarren went “full Hulk.” It normalized the event, stripping it of its power to shame him.
Jarren looked from our smiling faces to the still-wary doctors. He didn’t fully understand, but he understood the feeling in the room. He wasn’t being judged. He was being teased. Gently, lovingly. Like family.
He sank back into his pillow, a small, hesitant smile touching his own lips for the first time. The lightness he had felt earlier… it was growing. The fortress around him wasn't just protecting him; it was healing him with laughter.

The ice having been thoroughly broken, the rest of the medical check-up unfolded in an atmosphere of cautious, therapeutic humor. Dr. Adams, while examining the now-clean and bandaged wound, maintained a wide berth, treating Jarren’s good hand with the respect one might afford a sleeping cobra.
“Alright, Jarren,” the doctor said, his voice regaining some of its clinical authority, though his eyes still held a hint of wariness. “The inflammation is down. The fever is gone. That’s excellent news. We’re going to keep you on the IV antibiotics for another 24 hours just to be safe.” He gently palpated the area around the bandage. “Any pain when I press here?”
Jarren shook his head. “No, just… sore.”
“Good. That’s what we want,” Dr. Adams said, making a note on his chart. He then turned to the nurse. “Let’s get a new dressing on there. And let’s make sure we have everything we need this time.” He shot a pointed look at the corner of the room where a small pile of broken glass had been swept up.
Triston snorted. “Yeah, Doc, maybe use a plastic cup for the water this time. Less… aerodynamic.”
Jarren’s face flushed again, a mixture of embarrassment and amusement. “I really threw it at him?” he whispered to Cora.
“Like you were trying to cut down a runner at the plate,” Cora confirmed with a grin. “Your mechanics were perfect. A little high and inside, but the intent was there.”
As the nurse began to carefully unwrap the old bandage, Jarren, his throat still hoarse, looked around. “Hey, can I… can I get some water?”
Without thinking, I turned to the bedside table. My hand automatically reached for the spot where the heavy glass water pitcher had been the day before. My fingers met empty air. I froze, my hand hovering, the memory of the shattering glass and the doctor’s panicked dive flashing in my mind.
I looked at the empty space, then at Jarren, then back at the empty space.
Cora saw it. “Uh, Craig?” he said, a laugh building in his voice. “I think that pitcher has been… decommissioned. Sent down to Triple-A for a rehab assignment.”
Triston roared with laughter. “Yeah, man. It got DFA’d. Designated For Annihilation.”
I couldn’t help but chuckle, shaking my head at my own reflexive action. “Right. My mistake.” I looked at the nurse. “Could we get a… uh… a plastic bottle of water, please? Maybe two, in case the first one gets a little aggressive.”
The nurse, finally cracking a smile, nodded and scurried out of the room.
The joke, born from a moment of pure terror, was now a running gag. It was our way of talking about the unspeakable. We weren’t ignoring what happened; we were defanging it, turning the monster of his delirium into a slightly ridiculous mascot. Every time we mentioned the pitcher, we were reminding Jarren not of his breakdown, but of the fact that he had completely terrified a room full of grown men. It subtly reframed him not as a patient who had lost control, but as a force of nature that had been temporarily unleashed.
Jarren watched this all unfold, a look of dawning wonder on his face. He had expected whispers, awkward silences, a permanent cloud of shame. He had never imagined… this. He had never imagined that the worst moment of his life could become a source of shared laughter.
When the nurse returned with a plastic bottle of water, she handed it to me with an exaggerated, theatrical caution. I took it, weighed it in my hand playfully, and then presented it to Jarren.
“Here you go,” I said, my expression deadpan. “Try not to put this one through the wall. The stadium budget isn’t what it used to be.”
He took the bottle, his lips curling into a genuine, unforced smile. He looked around the room, at his manager, his GM, his teammate, all of them grinning. The heavy burden on his shoulders felt another pound lighter. The air in the room was clean, and for the first time, he felt like he could breathe it.
<doctors suggested solid food for lunch><Jarren had no stomach for that after the fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details. Write as long as you need>
After the check-up was complete and the doctors had departed (with a few more parting jokes about wearing helmets on their next visit), a comfortable quiet settled over the room. The game day preparations were now in full swing outside, a distant, muffled hum of a world getting back to normal. Inside our small sanctuary, however, the focus remained singular.
A clubhouse attendant knocked softly and entered with a tray. “Lunch for Jarren,” he said, placing it on the rolling table. On it was a plate of grilled chicken, steamed rice, and broccoli—the standard, healthy fare for an athlete.
Jarren looked at the plate, and his face, which had finally found some color, went pale again. The thought of solid food after the fever, the trauma, and the cocktail of medications was nauseating.
“I can’t,” he said, shaking his head and pushing the tray away slightly. “No appetite. My stomach’s… not right.”
“You gotta eat something, kid,” I said gently. “You’ve got nothing in the tank. Your body needs fuel to heal.”
“I know, but… I look at it and I just feel sick,” he admitted, his voice low.
Triston, ever the pragmatist, chimed in. “Just try the chicken, bro. It’s protein. Good for the muscles. You got a lot of muscles to rebuild after yesterday’s… uh… workout.” He winked.
Jarren managed a weak smile but still shook his head. “Later, maybe.”
He was shutting down, retreating. The refusal wasn’t just about a lack of appetite; it was a quiet act of control after a period of having none.
Alex Cora, who had been watching this exchange silently, stood up. He walked over to the tray, picked up the fork, and expertly cut a tiny, almost microscopic piece of the grilled chicken. He speared it with the fork.
He didn’t command. He didn’t plead. He just sat on the edge of the bed, holding the fork out. His expression was not one of a manager ordering a player to eat. It was the unmistakable look of a father trying to get his sick child to take a single bite of soup.
“One bite,” Cora said, his voice a low, gentle murmur. “That’s all I’m asking. For me. Not for the team, not for your health. For me. One bite.”
Jarren looked at the fork, then at Cora’s face. It was a battlefield of stubborn pride and a deep, instinctual desire not to disappoint this man who had become his shield. He saw the genuine, paternal concern in his manager’s eyes. This wasn’t an order to be defied. It was a request from someone who had earned his trust in the deepest way imaginable.
He sighed, a long, slow breath of surrender. He leaned forward, opened his mouth, and accepted the tiny piece of chicken.
He chewed slowly, his expression pained, as if he were swallowing medicine. He swallowed, then took a slow sip of water.
“There you go,” Cora said, his voice full of quiet approval. He didn’t push for a second bite. He just set the fork down on the plate. “That’s a start.”
It was a small act, but it was monumental. It was Jarren, for the second time in 24 hours, surrendering his own stubborn will to an act of care. He was learning, in small, incremental steps, to let other people help him.
Cora then picked up the bowl of plain white rice. He took the spoon, scooped up a small amount, and held it out. He didn’t say a word this time. He just waited.
After a moment’s hesitation, Jarren accepted the spoonful of rice. Then another. Cora didn’t rush him. He set a slow, patient rhythm, a silent conversation passing between them with each spoonful. It was a painstaking process, a negotiation with nausea and trauma.
I sat with Triston, watching the scene unfold. We were witnessing something far more important than a player eating lunch. We were watching a new language being learned, a new trust being forged, one tiny, difficult bite at a time. It was the slowest, most meaningful, and most triumphant meal I had ever seen.
<Cora forced everything down><Jarren Felt much better><He went to the dugout to watch the game in the afternoon><Teammates joked with him all the time><For the first time, he realized his teammates loved him just the same even if he was not contributing><add more details>
The process was a masterclass in patient, paternal persistence. Cora, with the unwavering focus of a man on a mission, worked his way through the entire plate. A tiny piece of chicken. A small spoonful of rice. A single floret of broccoli, which elicited a grimace from Jarren but was accepted nonetheless. Each bite was a small victory, a quiet negotiation between Cora’s gentle insistence and Jarren’s waning resistance.
By the time the plate was clean, a remarkable transformation had taken place. The simple act of getting fuel into his system had worked a quiet magic. The pale, greenish tint to Jarren’s skin had receded, replaced by a healthier, more natural color. The deep, exhausted shadows under his eyes seemed a little lighter. He sat up straighter in the bed, the profound lethargy beginning to lift.
“Feel better?” Cora asked, setting the empty tray aside with a look of quiet satisfaction.
Jarren blinked, as if surprised by the answer himself. “Yeah,” he said, his voice stronger than it had been all day. “Yeah, I actually… I do. A lot better.”
He looked at the empty plate, then at Cora, a look of grudging, grateful respect in his eyes. He had been so sure he couldn’t eat, but Cora had known better. He had been cared for, even against his own will, and the result was undeniable.
An hour later, restless and energized by the food, he swung his legs off the bed. “I can’t just sit in here,” he announced. “I want to watch the game.”
Before I could object, Cora nodded. “Okay. But you’re not going out there in a hospital gown. Get some clothes on. And you stay in the dugout. No tunnels, no cages. You just sit and watch. Deal?”
“Deal,” Jarren agreed immediately.
His arrival in the dugout in the third inning was a quiet event. He wore sweats and a team hoodie, his bandaged hand held carefully at his side. He found an empty spot at the far end of the bench, intending to be an invisible observer.
The team had other plans.
The moment there was a lull in the action, Trevor Story, the veteran shortstop, ambled over. He sat down next to Jarren, looked at the bandage, and said with a completely straight face, “So, I heard you redecorated the trainer’s room. Little minimalist, little abstract expressionist. Bold choice.”
Jarren flushed, but a smile tugged at his lips. “Something like that.”
A few minutes later, Devers, on his way to the bat rack, stopped and pointed at the bandage. “Hey, papi,” he said, his voice full of mock concern. “You need me to kiss it and make it better?” He blew a loud, exaggerated kiss toward Jarren’s hand.
The entire dugout erupted in laughter. Jarren found himself laughing along with them, a real, genuine laugh that felt rusty from disuse.
It went on like that all game. Every player who came back to the bench had something to say. They weren’t asking if he was okay. They weren’t treating him like a fragile piece of glass. They were treating him like one of them. They joked about his “new weapon,” asking if he could throw a water pitcher with a two-seam or a four-seam grip. They ribbed him about his new “mummy hand.” They made him a part of the game’s rhythm, even though he wasn’t playing.
He sat on that bench, surrounded by the easy camaraderie and the relentless, good-natured teasing, and a profound, revolutionary thought began to take root in his mind.
He was on the Injured List. He was contributing nothing to the team on the field. He had, in his own mind, failed spectacularly and shown unforgivable weakness. And yet… they were still here. They were still joking with him. They were still treating him like a brother.
His value to them, he was beginning to understand, was not solely based on his performance. He could be hurt, he could be on the bench, he could be contributing zero home runs and zero stolen bases… and they still wanted him around. They still saw him as Jarren, their teammate.
He looked down the bench at the row of his teammates, laughing and yelling and spitting seeds, a chaotic, dysfunctional, beautiful family. And he felt a sense of belonging that was deeper and more real than any he had ever felt after hitting a home run. The love, he was starting to believe, wasn't just unconditional from his manager. It was unconditional from his team. He was one of them, whether he was playing like an MVP or not playing at all. And that realization was more healing than any antiseptic.
