Framing the Fury
I'm focusing on Duran's fury post-substitution. I'm exploring the nuances of his anger: Is it directed at the coach, himself, or the situation? I'm visualizing the specific context of the injury, and how it impacts his emotional state. I'm going to pinpoint the most compelling way to portray this.
Structuring the Narrative
I've been breaking down the scene into distinct parts. The initial focus is on the dugout fallout, showcasing Duran's raw anger alongside Cora's stoicism and teammate reactions, which helps establish the core conflict. Concurrently, I'm imagining Breslow's perspective, managing the situation from his office, coordinating with Cora, and bracing for a more difficult conversation.
Analyzing the Conflict
I'm now diving into the Breslow-Duran conversation, the climax. I'm focusing on crafting a compelling exchange that goes beyond a power dynamic. The essence is a clash of cultures, old versus new, with the injury as a catalyst. I'm trying to ensure the dialogue feels authentic and impactful, not just a lecture.
Refining the Conflict
I'm now fully immersed in the Breslow-Duran conversation. I'm focusing on their perspectives - the evolving landscape of baseball versus traditional player mentality. I'm attempting to portray a more nuanced clash of personalities, not a simple power struggle. I'm aiming for authentic dialogue that resonates with the emotional weight of the situation.
Deepening the Narrative
I've outlined each section, establishing the immediate fallout with specific actions. The focus is now on visual details, showing Duran's anger. I'm imagining Cora's stoic response, Devers' detached gaze, and Yoshida's professional demeanor. In Breslow's office, I'm developing his internal monologue, connecting his actions to the stakes established earlier.
Analyzing the Scene
I'm now zeroing in on the trainer's room conversation. I'm building Breslow's empathy and incorporating the time traveler's insights into his argument. I'm focusing on crafting a compelling exchange, with the turning point being Duran's receptiveness to Breslow's approach. I'm aiming for authentic dialogue that resonates with the emotional weight of the situation.
Structuring the Scene
I'm now building out each part of the scene: Duran's fury, Breslow's perspective, and the crucial conversation. I'm focusing on their actions and thoughts to make sure the conflict feels authentic. Duran's anger needs to be shown, not just told, while Breslow navigates with a nuanced approach. This will lead to an impactful climax and resolution.
The dugout camera on the broadcast feed was a small, grainy window into a silent explosion. Jarren Duran stormed down the steps, his face a thundercloud of pure, unadulterated fury. He ripped his helmet off and slammed it into the bat rack with a crack that I could almost feel through the television screen. It wasn’t the sound of frustration. It was the sound of betrayal.
He began to pace the narrow confines of the dugout like a caged panther, refusing to look at anyone. Alex Cora stood by the top step, his arms crossed, his expression unreadable as he watched the pinch-hitter, Rob Refsnyder, take his place in the batter’s box. Cora didn’t look at Duran. He was giving him space, letting the fire burn itself out in the contained environment.
I saw Trevor Story, a few feet away, watch Duran’s tirade for a moment before turning back to the game with the quiet, weary understanding of a veteran who has seen it all. Rafael Devers watched from the bench, a thoughtful, almost curious expression on his face, as if analyzing a problem he hadn't encountered before. The message was clear: the manager had made a decision, and the team was moving on. But Jarren wasn’t moving on. He was trapped in the moment, betrayed by a decision he couldn’t comprehend.
My phone buzzed. It was Alex.
“He’s pissed,” Cora said, his voice low and calm amidst the chaos I was witnessing. “But he’ll live. The trainers are going to talk to him now.”
“Good,” I said, my own voice steady. The relief I felt was immense, but it was immediately replaced by the cold reality of the next step. “The hard part starts now, Alex. Hold the line in the dugout. I’ll handle the rest.”
“You got it,” he said, and hung up.
I watched the screen as the trainer, Nick Paparesta, approached Duran cautiously. Duran waved him off violently, turning his back. Paparesta didn’t retreat. He just stood there, a calm, waiting presence. This was the new protocol in action. We don’t ask. We don’t retreat. We wait.
I minimized the game feed and pulled up my email. I drafted a short, precise message to our head of communications. “Prepare a statement. Jarren Duran, left tonight’s game as a precautionary measure with right side discomfort. He will be re-evaluated by the medical staff post-game. Emphasize ‘precautionary.’” I was getting ahead of the narrative. This wasn’t a punishment. This was a medical decision.
The game played on. Refsnyder struck out, ending the inning. The team took the field. Duran remained on the bench, a solitary figure stewing in his own anger.
The next two hours were the longest of my career. I watched the game, but my mind was in that clubhouse, planning the conversation that would define the future of my relationship with our most dynamic player. We won the game, 6-3. It felt completely irrelevant.
After the final out, I waited. I gave them time for the post-game handshakes, for the media scrum with Cora, for the players to start filtering out. Then I made my way down from the executive offices, taking the quiet back elevators and hallways that snaked through the guts of the stadium.
I found him in the trainer’s room. He was sitting on an examination table, shirtless, his jaw still set in a hard line. The trainer was finishing a preliminary exam, pressing gently on his side. Duran barely flinched, his body rigid with defiance.
I nodded to the trainer. “Can you give us a minute, Nick?”
He nodded back and quietly exited, closing the door behind him. The room was sterile, smelling of rubbing alcohol and athletic tape. For a long moment, neither of us spoke.
I didn’t stand over him. I pulled up a rolling stool and sat down, so we were at eye level.
“I know you’re furious with me,” I began, my voice quiet. “You have every right to be. I made a call that embarrassed you and made you feel like we don’t trust you. I own that.”
He finally looked at me, his eyes burning. “It was a cramp, Craig. A cramp. I could have played. You made me look weak.”
“No,” I said firmly, but without anger. “I didn’t. I made you look protected. There’s a difference.”
I leaned forward. “Jarren, we had this conversation. I told you we were going to be smarter. I told you we were going to prioritize the long-term. That wasn’t just talk. Tonight was the first test. That fire you have, that absolute refusal to quit… that’s what makes you a superstar. I will never, ever try to take that away from you. But that fire, if it’s not controlled, will burn the whole damn house down. My job is to be the fire extinguisher.”
“So you humiliate me in the middle of an at-bat?” he shot back, his voice raw.
“I pulled a player who was visibly favoring an injury that could have turned into a season-ending oblique tear,” I corrected him gently. “I did it to protect one of the most valuable assets this franchise has. I did it to make sure you are in the lineup when we are playing for a playoff spot in September, not sitting on the IL because we let you be a hero in August.”
He looked away, staring at the wall. He was listening.
“This is the new rule,” I said, my voice softening. “For you. For Devers. For Bello. For everyone. We are building a culture where the organization takes the responsibility of saying ‘when.’ We will not put that burden on our players anymore. Your job is to tell us how you feel. Our job is to make the hard decision. Tonight, you told us you were hurting, even if you didn’t use words. I listened.”
He was silent for a full minute. I could see the war happening behind his eyes. The lifetime of programming telling him this was weakness, this was failure, clashing with the logic of what I was saying.
“You didn’t call me weak,” he said finally, the words quiet, almost a question.
“Never,” I replied instantly. “I called you vital. And vital things must be protected.”
The door opened and the trainer came back in, holding a tablet. He looked at me. “MRI is scheduled for 8 a.m. tomorrow.”
I stood up. “Good. Get some rest, Jarren. We’ll talk more tomorrow after we have the results.”
He didn’t respond. He just sat there on the table, staring at his hands. I had done all I could.
The next morning, I was in my office when the results came in. I read the email from the doctor twice.
“Grade 1 strain of the internal oblique muscle.”
It was exactly what she’d said. A minor tear. The kind of injury that, if ignored, becomes a major one. The kind of injury a player could absolutely play through, for a while. He would have hit that home run against Eovaldi. He would have been a hero for a day. And then he would have collapsed in September.
I called Alex. “We have the results. Grade 1 oblique strain. He’s out for two to three weeks.”
Cora let out a low whistle. “Good call, Craig. That was a good call.”
My final act was to walk into the press room myself to announce the IL move. I stood at the podium and explained that we had made a proactive decision based on a visual cue, and that the subsequent imaging had validated that caution. I praised Jarren’s incredible toughness, but I made it clear that the organization’s new philosophy was to protect players from their own competitive fire.
I was sending a message. To the media, to the fans, and to every player in our clubhouse.
The old way was over. The fires were being put out before they could spread. It was a messy, painful process. But as I walked out of that press conference, I knew, with an unshakeable certainty, that we had just saved our season.
<Red Sox won the AL pennant in 2024> <Breslow avoided Buehler and signed Nick Pivetta instead. Pivetta was good, ERA 3.02> <Breslow had a full conversation with Devers before he bought in Bregman. Devers felt respected and accepted the move happily.> <Bregman became another clubhouse leader, along with Jarren Duran><May 2nd, 2025, series opener at Fenway against twins. Bello pitching. Top 2, Duran dived for a line drive and caught it. He landed on the warning track in foul territory. His left hand grinded on the hard ground.

Later I'll provide you with more details for what happened in the trainer's room>
The air in my office on May 2nd, 2025, was different. It was lighter. The scent of Fenway Park wasn’t one of stale beer and anxiety, but of fresh-cut grass and possibility. We were the reigning American League Champions. The offseason had been a series of smart, calculated moves built on a foundation of trust, not desperation. Nick Pivetta was a solid, reliable arm in the rotation. The conversation with Raffy about the Bregman signing had been a masterclass in communication, turning a potential crisis into a statement of our all-in mentality. The clubhouse was strong, led by the twin pillars of Bregman’s veteran savvy and Duran’s relentless, now smartly-managed, fire.
I was watching the game against the Twins on the big screen, my posture relaxed, a half-finished cup of coffee on my desk. It was a cool spring evening. Bello was on the mound, looking sharp.
Top of the second inning. A Twins batter ripped a sinking line drive down the left-field line. It looked like a sure double. But Jarren Duran, moving with the explosive grace that was his signature, launched himself into a full-extension dive. He snagged the ball just inches from the grass, his body skidding across the red dirt of the warning track in foul territory.
“What a play!” Dave O’Brien’s voice boomed from the speakers. “Unbelievable! Jarren Duran saves a run with a spectacular diving catch!”
But I wasn’t watching the ball in his glove. I was watching him get up.
He popped to his feet, pumped his fist, and jogged back toward his position. As he turned, the camera zoomed in. His left arm, from the palm to the elbow, was coated in a thick, crimson smear. The announcers, the crowd, they all saw what I saw.
“And look at that!” O’Brien exclaimed. “He is covered in the Fenway dirt! That’s what you call leaving it all on the field, folks!”
My coffee cup stopped halfway to my lips. My blood ran cold.
It wasn’t dirt.
I slammed the mug down, coffee sloshing over the rim. My hand was already on my phone, my thumb hovering over Alex Cora’s name. This was it. The fire alarm. The irrelevant precursor.
When Duran bleeds, pull Casas.
My heart hammered against my ribs. This was the moment. The test. Not of my courage, but of my conviction. Could I make the most illogical, inexplicable move in baseball history based on the word of a ghost from another timeline?
I pressed the call button.
“Alex,” I said, my voice a low, urgent command the second he answered. “Code Red. Now.”
There was no confusion in his voice. We had established this protocol after the oblique incident. Code Red meant a direct, non-negotiable order from my office based on intelligence he wasn’t privy to. It was the ultimate test of his trust in me.
“What do you need?” he asked, his voice tight.
“Two things. First, the moment the inning ends, Duran is out of the game. Tell him it’s a mandatory medical removal to treat the abrasion. No arguments. Second, and this is the important part, Alex… Triston Casas does not take the field for the bottom of the second. He’s out of the game. Right now.”
The silence on the other end of the line was deafening. I could hear the gears turning in his mind, trying to find a single thread of logic to connect those two moves.
“Casas?” he finally asked, his voice laced with utter bewilderment. “Craig, he’s fine. He’s standing right here. What’s this about?”
“I can’t explain it right now, Alex,” I said, my voice hard as iron. “You have to trust me. Pull him. Put Toro at first base. Cite a tight hamstring, lower back stiffness, I don’t care what the reason is. He does not take another step on that field tonight. That is the most important instruction I will give you all season.”
I could feel his hesitation, his professional manager’s mind rebelling against the sheer insanity of the order. Pulling a healthy, 25-year-old first baseman in the second inning for no reason was managerial malpractice.
“Craig…” he started.
“Trust me, Alex,” I cut him off, my voice dropping to a near-whisper, imbued with all the weight of the secret I carried. “Trust me.”
Another beat of silence. Then, a sigh of resignation. “Okay, Craig. I trust you.”
He hung up.
I turned my full attention back to the screen, my body rigid with tension. The inning ended. As the team jogged off the field, I saw Alex meet Duran at the dugout steps. He pointed toward the clubhouse tunnel, his expression firm. Duran looked down at his bloody arm, then back at Cora, and gave a reluctant nod. He understood. This was the new way.
Then came the truly bizarre part. As the Red Sox prepared to bat in the bottom of the second, the camera panned to the dugout. Triston Casas was handing his helmet to Abraham Toro. He had a confused, slightly annoyed look on his face as Alex Cora spoke to him, gesturing toward the trainer’s room.
The announcers were completely baffled.
“Well, this is very strange,” Jerry Remy’s voice crackled with confusion. “It looks like not only is Jarren Duran coming out of the game, but so is Triston Casas. We saw Duran’s spectacular catch and the nasty scrape on his arm, so that move, while perhaps overly cautious, makes some sense. But Casas… he hasn’t done anything. He looks perfectly fine.”
I watched as Casas, shrugging his shoulders, disappeared down the same tunnel as Duran. Toro trotted out to the on-deck circle.
I let out a breath I felt like I had been holding for a year. They were off the field. Both of them. The dribbler down the line, the fumbled ball, the awkward acceleration, the trip, the rupture… none of it would happen. The timeline was broken.
I stood up from my desk, my legs feeling unsteady. I had just made the single most insane managerial decision of my career. I had alienated my starting first baseman and confused my entire coaching staff and fanbase.
But Triston Casas’s patellar tendon was still intact.
And in the quiet of my office, with the confused chatter of the announcers filling the air, I knew, with absolute certainty, that it was the best decision I would ever make. Now, I just had to go downstairs and face the fallout.
<Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> <As the mud was removed and the wound was exposed, everyone took a sharp breath> <add more details.Write as long as you need> <stop the scene here. >
I walked into the trainer’s room, and the smell hit me first—the sharp, metallic tang of blood mixed with the sterile scent of antiseptic. The atmosphere was tense, quiet. Two assistant trainers were working under the bright glare of an examination lamp, their movements precise and focused.
Jarren was seated on the edge of an examination table, his back to the door. He was shirtless, his posture ramrod straight. He hadn’t moved since I’d last seen him on the monitor. His right hand was clamped onto the padded edge of the table, a death grip that was the only outward sign of the war he was waging against the pain. A fine sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead and across the powerful muscles of his back. He was a statue of pure, controlled agony.
Triston Casas was on the other side of the room, sitting on a bench, a look of profound confusion and irritation on his face. He saw me enter and opened his mouth to speak, but I held up a hand, my eyes fixed on the scene at the table. He closed his mouth, sensing the gravity in the room.
I walked over and stood near Jarren’s side, close enough to offer a presence but not so close as to crowd him. I watched as one of the trainers, a young woman named Sarah, worked with a pair of tweezers, gently picking bits of gravel and red clay out of the raw flesh of his forearm. The other trainer, Mike, was carefully irrigating the wound with a saline solution.
Jarren didn’t make a sound. He just stared straight ahead at the white cinderblock wall, his breathing a low, steady rhythm. It was the breathing of a man enduring something, a technique learned through a lifetime of practice.
“How bad is it?” I asked quietly, my voice just for the trainers.
“It’s deep, Craig,” Mike said without looking up. “The warning track took off a few layers of skin. It’s the kind of abrasion that looks simple but can get infected easily if we don’t get every particle out.”
As he spoke, Sarah used a sterile gauze pad to wipe away a layer of blood and mud from the center of the wound on Jarren’s palm. And then she stopped.
Mike stopped.
I stopped breathing.
Underneath the grime and the blood, now exposed to the harsh light, was the wound. It wasn’t a simple scrape. The warning track hadn’t just taken off skin; it had acted like a cheese grater. The flesh was a mangled, angry red lattice of torn tissue. It was deep, it was ragged, and it was shockingly, brutally raw.
A collective, sharp intake of breath filled the small room. It was an involuntary sound of shared, empathetic pain. Even Casas, from across the room, let out a low, “Jeez, man.”
I saw Jarren’s shoulders tense at the sound. His grip on the table tightened, his knuckles now completely white. He was fighting not just the pain, but the humiliation of having his wound, his weakness, exposed for everyone to see.
I moved then, stepping directly into his line of sight, blocking his view of the others. I put a hand gently on his right shoulder, the one that wasn’t injured. His muscles were coiled as tight as a spring.
“I’m right here, Jarren,” I said, my voice low and calm. “Just breathe. They’re almost done.”
He didn’t look at me. He just kept staring at the wall, but I felt a flicker of acknowledgment, a slight easing of the tension under my hand.
“Mike,” I said, my voice firm, taking command of the room. “Forget everything else. Pain management is now the priority. Let’s get it numbed before you do anything else.”
“Right away, Craig,” he said, already moving to a supply cabinet.
I kept my hand on Jarren’s shoulder. I could feel the tremors of pain and adrenaline running through him. He was still the boy in the park, trying not to cry, trying not to show that it hurt. But this time, he wasn’t alone. And this time, the person in charge wasn’t the one causing the pain. He was the one trying to make it stop.
<imagine the rest of the process><add more details><write as long as you need>
Revising Scene Elements
I've been focusing on the core request: the continuation of the scene in the trainer's room. I'm taking into account the established elements: Jarren's intense, stoic pain, and Casas's confusion. I am now considering how to best present these elements moving forward. I'm thinking about the most compelling way to build tension.
Refining the Approach
I'm now zeroing in on the next steps. Pain management is the priority, specifically the lidocaine injection. Jarren's reaction to the offer of relief is a key character moment I'm exploring. How does his stoicism clash with potential weakness? Casas's confusion presents an opportunity for Craig to clarify the "why" behind the new culture, explaining the protection aspect of the situation. I'm carefully considering the emotional weight of the cleaning process itself.
Integrating the Details
I've been working through the steps now. The needle as a symbol of vulnerability, with Jarren's stoic reaction, feels like the right opening. I'm focusing on the contrast, the tension between Jarren's ingrained response to pain and the new culture of care I'm aiming to establish. I see the injection and its aftermath as a pivotal turning point, allowing for clarification to Casas on the "why" behind this culture.
Deepening the Character Focus
I'm now shifting focus to Jarren's internal struggle. The scene's emotional core lies in his conflict: his stoicism versus the offer of care. The needle and the "why" explanation are in place, but I want to dive deeper into Jarren's reaction to being cared for, which will be a key moment. Craig needs to frame the offer to Jarren in a way that doesn't feel like a slight. I'm exploring language and phrasing that emphasizes smart decisions over perceived weakness.
Expanding the Narrative
I've been working through the steps outlined and thinking about the language used, especially the dialogue. Crafting the exchange between Craig, Jarren, and Casas is key. I'm focusing on the contrast between Jarren's stoicism and Craig's offer of care. The dialogue needs to convey respect while establishing the new culture of protection. I've been considering how to use the cleaning process itself as a visual representation of change. The scene's emotional core, for me, lies in Jarren's internal conflict and his eventual acceptance.
Finalizing Scene Elements
I'm now fully immersed in the scene. I am now working on the moment of injection and how it will play out. The core elements of Craig's conviction, Jarren's internal conflict and Casas's crucial role in understanding and witnessing are now clear. The scene feels like it's beginning to take shape. I'm focusing on the dialogue for emotional weight. I am now finalizing the details for a compelling climax, considering how the scene will come to a head and make the new culture clear to all involved.
Mike returned with a vial of Lidocaine and a syringe. The sight of the needle, sharp and sterile under the bright light, seemed to suck the remaining air out of the room. It was one thing to endure the grinding pain of an abrasion; it was another to willingly accept the sharp, piercing pain of an injection.
I saw Jarren’s eyes track the needle. His jaw tightened. This was a new kind of test, one that his old programming wasn’t equipped for. His father had taught him to endure pain, not to accept help in preventing it.
“Alright, Jarren,” Mike said, his voice gentle but professional. “This will sting for a second, but then you won’t feel a thing. We need to numb the area to clean it properly.”
Jarren’s gaze flickered from the needle to my face. His eyes were a storm of conflict: pride, pain, and a deep, ingrained resistance to what felt like surrender.
I leaned in closer, my voice low, meant only for him. “This is part of it, Jarren. This is the new way. Toughness isn’t just gritting your teeth. It’s being smart enough to use the tools that let you heal faster. Let us help you. This is how we keep you on the field.”
I was giving him a new definition of strength. Not enduring the pain, but commanding the situation. He held my gaze for a long moment, searching. Then, he gave a single, almost imperceptible nod and turned his eyes back to the cinderblock wall. He was giving us permission.
I kept my hand on his shoulder as Mike administered a series of small injections around the perimeter of the mangled flesh. Jarren flinched with each prick of the needle, a sharp intake of breath, but he didn’t pull away. He held his ground. After a minute, I felt the iron-hard tension under my palm begin to release. The death grip his right hand had on the table slackened. The lines of pain on his face softened. The numbness was working. It was a small victory, but it felt monumental.
With the immediate crisis being managed, I turned my attention to the other confused and angry player in the room. I walked over to Triston Casas, who was watching the entire scene with wide, bewildered eyes.
“Triston,” I said quietly, pulling up another stool to sit near him. “I owe you an explanation.”
“I’d say so, Craig,” he said, his voice a low rumble of frustration. “You pulled me from a game in the second inning. I feel fine. What the hell is going on?”
I looked him straight in the eye. I couldn’t tell him the truth, so I had to give him a truth he could understand.
“I had a gut feeling,” I said, my voice low and sincere. “Call it paranoia, call it whatever you want. I saw the way the field was playing after the rain yesterday. I saw Duran go down. And I had a sudden, overwhelming feeling that we were in a high-risk situation for a non-contact injury. A freak accident. And I couldn’t shake it.”
He looked skeptical, as he should have. “A gut feeling? You pulled me from a game because of a gut feeling?”
“Yes,” I said, my voice unwavering. “And I need you to understand this, Triston, because this is the new philosophy of this organization. I would rather pull you from a game for no reason and look like a complete, paranoid idiot to you, to the media, and to the entire city, than to not act on that feeling and watch you get carried off the field with a season-ending injury. Your health, and the health of every man on this team, is more important than me saving face. It’s more important than one game in May.”
I pointed with my chin toward the other side of the room, where the trainers were now able to work on Jarren’s arm with a grim efficiency, scrubbing and cleaning without causing him to recoil in agony.
“That,” I said to Casas, “is a best-case scenario for a player leaving it all on the field. It’s still going to cost him weeks. I will do anything in my power, no matter how unorthodox it seems, to prevent the worst-case scenario from ever happening to you or anyone else.”
Casas followed my gaze. He saw the mangled reality of Duran’s arm. He saw the seriousness on the faces of the trainers. He looked back at me, at the absolute, unshakable conviction in my eyes. The anger on his face slowly faded, replaced by a dawning, reluctant understanding. He didn’t get it. But he believed that I believed it. And for now, that was enough.
“Okay, Craig,” he said slowly, shaking his head. “Okay. It’s crazy. But… okay.”
I gave him a nod of gratitude and turned back to Jarren. The cleaning was almost done. The angry red flesh was now sterile, free of the dirt that had been ground into it. Mike was applying a thick layer of antibiotic ointment before covering it with a non-stick pad.
“Alright, son,” Mike said, his voice gentle. “The worst is over.” He began wrapping the entire area, from palm to forearm, in a thick, white layer of sterile gauze. What was once a bloody, mangled mess was now a clean, protected bundle.
“It’s bad,” Mike said, looking at me. “No breaks, but it’s a significant soft tissue injury. He’ll need a course of strong antibiotics to fight off infection. He’s on the 10-day IL, minimum. We’ll have to see him every day to change the dressing and monitor the healing.”
I nodded. “Do it.”
I turned back to Jarren. He was looking down at his now-mummified arm, a strange expression on his face. It wasn’t anger anymore. It was a quiet, weary resignation.
“I know you could have kept playing,” I said softly. “That’s what makes you who you are. We all know it.”
He looked up at me.
“But we’re not going to let you,” I continued, my voice firm but kind. “Not with this. Your only job for the next ten days is to heal. That’s it. You come in, you get treatment, you rest. You let your body do its work. That’s your new challenge. Can you do that for us?”
He looked at his bandaged arm, then at my face, then over at Triston Casas, who was still watching with a look of dawning comprehension. He saw the whole picture. The caution. The protection. The seemingly insane lengths the organization would now go to keep its players whole.
He took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
“Yeah, Craig,” he said, his voice raspy. “I can do that.”
<Jarren remained still when the mud was removed. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> <As the wound was exposed, everyone took a sharp breath> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene before describing what the wound actually looked like. >
I walked through the quiet concrete corridors beneath the stands, the distant, muffled roar of the crowd a world away. Each step echoed, a countdown to a confrontation I had engineered but was not fully prepared for. I bypassed the manager’s office and the clubhouse, heading straight for the one place I knew they would be: the trainer’s room.
The door was slightly ajar. I pushed it open and stepped inside.
The scene was one of quiet, controlled tension. The room smelled sharply of antiseptic and medical tape. Jarren Duran was seated in a high-backed examination chair, his left arm extended, resting on a stainless-steel tray. A young assistant trainer was gently dabbing at his forearm with a saline-soaked gauze pad, meticulously working to clear away the caked-on mixture of dirt, grass, and blood.
Jarren was shirtless, his athletic frame rigid. He stared straight ahead at the blank white wall, his jaw clenched so tight a muscle jumped along his cheek. He wasn’t making a sound, but his stillness was louder than any scream. His right hand was clamped onto the armrest of the chair, his knuckles bone-white, a desperate anchor in a sea of pain. A fine sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead under the harsh fluorescent lights.
Triston Casas was there too, leaning against a counter on the far side of the room, his arms crossed over his chest. His face was a thundercloud of confusion and barely concealed anger. He looked at me the moment I walked in, his eyes demanding an explanation he felt he was owed. Nick Paparesta, the head trainer, stood between them, a silent observer trying to maintain a professional calm in a room crackling with unspoken questions.
I ignored Casas for the moment. My focus was on Duran.
“How is it, Nick?” I asked, my voice low and even.
“We’re getting there, Craig,” Paparesta replied, his tone professional. “The abrasion is extensive. The warning track took off a good layer of skin. We need to get it completely clean before we can assess the real damage.”
I nodded and moved closer, standing beside the chair so Jarren could see me in his peripheral vision. I didn’t speak to him yet. I just stood there, a silent, supportive presence. I was making good on my promise. We’re in this together.
The assistant trainer continued his work, his movements slow and deliberate. With each gentle wipe, more of the grime came away, revealing the raw, angry flesh beneath. The room was silent, the only sounds the soft rustle of the gauze and the quiet, controlled breathing of the man in the chair.
Casas finally broke the silence. “So, is anyone going to tell me what the hell is going on?” he demanded, his voice tight with frustration. “I feel fine. I didn’t do anything. Why am I in here getting pulled from a game in the second inning?”
I held up a hand, my eyes still on Duran. “Patience, Triston. I promise you’ll get an explanation. Right now, let’s focus on your teammate.”
My words had the intended effect. Casas fell silent, his anger momentarily checked by the reminder of his duty to the team. He looked over at Duran, really looked at him, and his expression softened slightly as he took in the rigid posture, the white-knuckled grip, the sweat on his brow.
The assistant trainer finished the initial cleaning. He stepped back, dropping the blood-soaked pads into a biohazard bag. “Okay,” he said softly. “That’s the worst of it.”
Paparesta moved in, adjusting the bright overhead lamp to get a better look. He leaned over Jarren’s arm, his expression clinical.
For the first time, the full extent of the wound was exposed under the bright, unforgiving light.
And as one, every person in the room—me, Paparesta, the assistant, even the still-angry Casas—sucked in a sharp, collective breath.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. > <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> <imagine everyone’s reaction> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene here. >
The sterile air in the room seemed to crystallize, the silence shattered by that single, sharp intake of breath. The sound was visceral, an involuntary chorus of shock and empathy.
It wasn’t a scrape. It wasn’t a cut. It was an excavation.
A huge patch of skin on the pinky side of his palm, easily a third of its surface area, was simply gone. The unforgiving warning track hadn’t just scraped him; it had acted like a belt sander, grinding away the epidermis and dermis, leaving behind a horrifying landscape of raw, exposed tissue. The wound was a ghastly mosaic of deep, weeping red and the pale, glistening white of the subcutaneous layer. It wasn’t bleeding profusely anymore; it was oozing, a testament to the depth of the abrasion. It looked less like a baseball injury and more like something from a burn unit.
My own stomach lurched. I had seen hundreds of injuries in my career—gruesome compound fractures, torn ligaments, faces stitched back together after a bad hop. But there was something uniquely awful about this. It was the sheer, raw, flayed nature of it. The thought of him sliding on that, grinding it deeper into the dirt, made my own hand ache in sympathy.
Nick Paparesta, to his credit, remained the consummate professional, but even he couldn’t hide the flicker of shock in his eyes. He leaned in closer, his voice dropping into a low, clinical tone, more for his own benefit than for ours. “My God. The entire dermal layer is gone. We’ve got exposed adipose tissue here.” He gently prodded the edge of the wound with a sterile swab, and Jarren’s entire body went rigid, a silent, powerful testament to the agony he was enduring. His right hand squeezed the armrest so hard I thought the metal might bend.
The young assistant trainer looked pale, his eyes wide. He had the look of a man who had just seen the vast difference between a textbook injury and the real, messy, painful thing.
But the most telling reaction came from the other side of the room.
Triston Casas, who had been radiating righteous indignation just moments before, took an involuntary step forward. His anger vanished, replaced by a look of pure, unadulterated horror. His mouth was slightly agape, his arms uncrossing and falling limp at his sides.
“Jesus Christ, JD,” he breathed, the words a soft, shocked prayer. “Is that… is that from the dive?”
Jarren didn’t answer. He couldn’t. He was somewhere else, a place of pure, white-hot pain, his entire consciousness focused on the simple act of not screaming.
Casas looked from the mangled hand to my face, and for the first time, the anger in his eyes was gone, replaced by a dawning, confused understanding. He was beginning to realize that this was not a normal situation. He didn’t know why he had been pulled, but he could see with his own two eyes that the event that had triggered it was far more severe than anyone in the ballpark could have possibly imagined. The sheer, brutal reality of Duran’s injury had silenced his own complaints completely.
I met Casas’s gaze and gave him a single, slow nod, my own face a grim mask. This is why, the look said. This is what matters right now.
I turned my attention back to the man in the chair. The sweat was now trickling down his temples, carving paths through the dust on his face. He was still staring at the wall, his breathing shallow and controlled. He was putting on a performance of toughness so profound it was almost unbearable to watch. He was back in the park with his father, refusing to cry, refusing to run home.
“Nick,” I said, my voice low and firm, breaking the spell. “What’s the protocol here? This needs more than a bandage.”
Paparesta straightened up, his focus snapping back. “No, this is a specialist issue. We need to debride this properly, get him on a course of heavy-duty antibiotics immediately to prevent infection. This is a significant soft tissue injury. He’s not going to be gripping a bat or putting on a glove for a while.”
He looked at me, his eyes grave. “Craig, this is a multi-week injury. At a minimum.”
I looked at Jarren’s white-knuckled hand, at the sweat on his brow, at the raw, gaping wound on his palm. And I thought of the story I had been told. The story of him re-injuring it on a slide, of playing through the pain, of opponents targeting it, of a three-week slump born from agony.
Not this time.
“I agree,” I said, my voice leaving no room for debate. “He’s going on the 10-day IL, effective immediately. And he is not to touch a baseball until you, and a hand specialist, give him a 100% clearance. We are not rushing this by a single day.”
I looked at Jarren, who still hadn’t moved, still hadn’t spoken.
“You hear that, Jarren?” I said softly. “Your only job now is to heal. That’s it. The team will be fine. We’ll hold down the fort. Your job is to let your body recover.”
I was speaking to him, but my words were also for Casas, for the trainers, for the entire organization. I was laying down the law. The new law. We protect the player. No matter what.

<the debridement started with forceps> <Jarren’s whole body was shaking and almost curled into fetal position. > <Jarren panicked when trainer picked up the scalpel for deeper particels. He used defiance to disguise his panic. He told the trainer ‘It’s clean. Stop it.’> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene here, before Craig and Casas talked Jarren into accepting the scalpel>
The air in the room, already thick with tension, became heavy and suffocating. Paparesta nodded to his assistant, who retrieved a sterile surgical kit. The metallic click of the latch opening seemed to echo in the silence.
“Alright, Jarren,” Nick said, his voice calm and professional, a stark contrast to the grim task ahead. “This is the hard part. We have to debride the wound. That means removing any foreign material—dirt, turf fibers, anything—and any non-viable tissue. It’s the only way to prevent a serious infection and allow for proper healing. It’s not going to be pleasant.”
He pulled on a pair of sterile gloves. Jarren gave a single, sharp nod, his eyes still fixed on the wall. He was steeling himself, preparing for the onslaught.
Nick picked up a pair of forceps, the small metal tongs looking impossibly cruel. He leaned over the wound. “Okay, deep breath.”
The moment the forceps touched the raw, exposed tissue, Jarren’s body convulsed. A strangled gasp escaped his lips, a sound of pure, animal pain that he couldn’t suppress. His entire frame, which had been held in rigid defiance, began to tremble violently. The muscles in his back and shoulders coiled, his body instinctively trying to curl away from the source of the agony, pulling him into a semi-fetal position in the chair. His right hand, still gripping the armrest, was now shaking uncontrollably. The sweat on his forehead was no longer a sheen; it was pouring down his face, mingling with the grime of the game.
I stood my ground, my own hands clenched into fists at my sides. I felt helpless, a useless spectator to this necessary torture. My job was to make the hard decisions, but I had no power to lessen the pain they caused.
Across the room, Casas had gone pale. He looked like he was going to be sick. He had seen hundreds of players get hurt, but this was different. This wasn’t a clean break or a pulled muscle. This was a slow, meticulous, agonizing process. He was witnessing the true, brutal cost of a single moment of athletic brilliance.
Nick worked with a grim, focused efficiency, his movements precise despite the horror of the task. He’d pick at a piece of embedded turf, lift it, and Jarren’s body would jolt, a low groan rumbling in his chest. Each touch of the metal was a fresh wave of torment. It went on for what felt like an eternity, the pile of bloodied gauze pads growing, each one a testament to a battle being fought in that chair.
Finally, Nick straightened up, his own brow beaded with sweat. “Okay,” he said, his voice strained. “That’s what I can get with the forceps. But I can still see some deeper particles in there. If we leave them, we’re risking a staph infection that could go right to the bone.”
He turned and picked up a small, sterile scalpel. The light glinted off the razor-sharp edge of the blade.
And that’s when Jarren broke.
His head snapped around, his eyes, wild with pain and a rising tide of panic, finally focusing on the trainer. The defiance he had worn like armor was cracking, revealing the terrified man beneath.
“No,” he said, his voice a harsh, ragged gasp. “No. It’s clean. It’s clean enough.”
Nick paused, the scalpel held steady in his hand. “Jarren, it’s not. I can see it. We have to get it all.”
“I said it’s clean!” Jarren’s voice rose, cracking with a desperate, pleading fury. He tried to pull his arm back, but the pain was too great. “Stop it! Just wrap it up. I’m done. Stop it!”
It wasn’t the voice of a tough guy. It wasn’t the voice of a warrior. It was the voice of the little boy in the park, begging for the onslaught to end. He was using anger, the only defense he had ever known, to disguise his absolute terror. He had reached his limit. He had endured all the pain he could, and the sight of that blade was a horror too far. He was finally, desperately, trying to run home.
<Craig and Triston coaxed Jarren to accept the scalpel>
<some tissues had to be cut. Some particles are buried so deep that trained had to make a cut on the tissue to get the particle out>
<Jarren endured many cuts, but finally got enough>
<Jarren pulled his hand back. The combined force of Triston and Craig couldn’t pull his hand out>
<The fear is about not wanting to break down. Not wanting other people to see he’s hurt>
<add more details><Write as long as you need>
<Stop the scene here>
The room was frozen in a standoff, the air thick with Jarren’s ragged, panicked breaths. The scalpel in Nick’s hand was a silver line drawn in the sand, a boundary of pain Jarren refused to cross.
I knew I had to intervene. But I also knew that my voice, the voice of authority, might be the wrong one. I looked across the room and met Triston Casas’s eyes. His face was a mixture of shock, pity, and a dawning sense of purpose. He understood.
I gave him a subtle, almost imperceptible nod. Your turn.
Casas pushed himself off the counter and walked over, his usual easygoing swagger gone, replaced by a quiet, deliberate gravity. He didn’t approach Jarren from the front. He came around the side, entering his field of vision slowly, non-threateningly.
“Hey, JD,” Casas said, his voice surprisingly soft. “Hey, man, look at me.”
Jarren’s wild eyes darted from the scalpel to Casas’s face.
“I know, man. I know,” Triston said, his voice a low, soothing rumble. “That thing looks like something out of a horror movie. Nobody wants that coming at them. But look at Nick. He’s not trying to hurt you, bro. He’s trying to keep you from losing your whole damn hand to some flesh-eating bacteria. We need that hand. We need you.”
He pointed at the wound. “That thing you did out there? That dive? That saved Bello a double, maybe a triple. That’s a game-changing play. This,” he said, gesturing to the scalpel, “is just the shitty part that comes after. Let him finish. Let him do his job so you can get back to doing yours. We’ll be right here. We’re not going anywhere.”
It was a masterful appeal. It spoke to his courage, his value to the team, and it framed the procedure not as a punishment, but as a necessary step toward his return. It was a teammate talking to a teammate.
I stepped forward, adding my own voice, reinforcing the message from a different angle. “Triston’s right, Jarren,” I said calmly. “This isn’t a test of your toughness. You passed that test on the field. This is a medical necessity. The pain you feel now is temporary. An infection could be permanent. We are making this decision to protect your career. Let us help you. Let us do our job.”
I looked at Nick. “Is there anything we can do for the pain?”
“We can numb it,” Nick said immediately. “But the injection itself is going to hurt like hell going into that raw tissue.”
Jarren shook his head violently. “No. No more needles. Just… just get it over with.”
It was a concession. A small one, but it was enough. He slowly, reluctantly, extended his arm again, placing it back on the tray. He turned his head away, squeezing his eyes shut, his body braced for the next wave.
I put a hand on his right shoulder, the one that wasn’t injured. My grip was firm, a steady, grounding pressure. “We’re right here, Jarren. Breathe.”
Casas mirrored my action, placing his large hand on Jarren’s other shoulder. “Right here with you, bro.”
And so the ordeal began again. Nick, understanding he had a small window, worked with intense focus. The scalpel made its first delicate, precise cut. Jarren’s entire body went rigid, a silent scream trapped in his clenched jaw. I could feel the tremors of it through his shoulder, a raw, electric current of agony. My own hand tightened, trying to absorb some of the shock, to offer some small measure of shared burden.
It was brutal. Some particles were so deeply embedded that Nick had to make small, careful incisions into the already damaged tissue to pry them out. Each cut was a fresh betrayal, a new peak of pain. Jarren’s breathing became a series of sharp, ragged gasps. He was shaking so violently now that Triston and I had to hold him steady in the chair. He was fighting not just the pain, but his own body’s instinct to flee.
He endured five cuts. Six. Seven. He was a monument to human endurance, a man taking a lifetime of training in how to withstand pain and focusing it on this single, terrible point in time.
But everyone has a breaking point.
After the eighth cut, something inside him snapped. With a guttural roar that was part fury, part terror, part agony, he ripped his arm back. The force of it was explosive, primal. He pulled with such desperate strength that he yanked both my hand and Triston’s off his shoulders. He cradled his mangled hand to his chest, his body curled tightly around it, his shoulders heaving.
“ENOUGH!” he screamed, the word tearing from his throat. “I’M DONE! NO MORE!”
Nick froze, the scalpel held aloft. Triston and I exchanged a look of alarm. The defiance was gone. This was pure, unadulterated panic.
“Jarren, we’re almost there,” Nick said, trying to keep his voice steady.
“I DON’T CARE!” he yelled, his eyes wild. He scrambled back in the chair, trying to put as much distance as possible between himself and the instruments of his torture.
I reached for his arm again. “Jarren, we have to finish.”
He recoiled from my touch as if he’d been burned. “GET OFF ME!”
He held his injured arm to his chest with his right hand, creating an unbreakable seal. He was a fortress, and the drawbridge was up. The fear in his eyes was not just of the pain. It was something deeper. It was the fear of completely breaking down, of shattering into a million pieces in front of us. He was protecting the last vestiges of his control, the one thing he had left. He would not let us see him cry. He would not let us see him fail. He was back in the park, and this time, he was refusing to go back for more.
<Cora went in to hold Jarren's head to his chest, like a father> <Triston held Jarren's left arm> <Craig held Jarren from falling off the chair> <the debridement went on for a brutally long time> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene here, before antiseptic>
The door to the trainer’s room swung open. Alex Cora stood there, his face a grim mask. He must have heard the shouting from his office down the hall. He took in the scene in a single, sweeping glance: Nick frozen with the scalpel, me and Triston standing helpless, and Jarren, curled and broken in the chair, radiating pure terror.
Cora didn’t hesitate. He walked past all of us, his focus entirely on the man in the chair. He didn’t speak. He didn’t try to reason with him. He simply moved in, knelt down in front of the chair, and gently, firmly, pulled Jarren’s head forward until it was resting against his own chest. He wrapped one arm around the back of Jarren’s neck, holding him steady. It wasn’t the gesture of a manager. It was the gesture of a father.
“Shhh, mijo,” Cora murmured, his voice a low, soothing sound against Jarren’s ear. “It’s okay. It’s okay. We got you. We’re right here. Just breathe with me. In… and out. We got you.”
Jarren’s body, which had been a coiled spring of panicked resistance, sagged. The fight went out of him, replaced by a wave of shuddering, exhausted tremors. He was still holding his injured arm to his chest, but the desperate strength was gone. He leaned into Cora’s embrace, a silent, profound surrender. He had finally run home, and for the first time, someone was there to catch him.
I looked at Triston, and he looked at me. A silent, solemn understanding passed between us. This was the new mission. We were no longer coaxing. We were supporting. We were the wall that would allow him to endure this.
Triston moved back to Jarren’s left side. He didn’t try to pull the arm away. He gently took hold of Jarren’s bicep and forearm, his large hands providing a steady, immobilizing pressure. His touch wasn’t forceful; it was absolute. It said, I’m holding this for you now. You don’t have to.
I moved to Jarren’s right side, my hand resting on his back, my other arm bracing his side to keep him from slumping or falling from the chair as the waves of pain washed over him. We were a three-man vise of support, a human shield built around his brokenness.
Cora looked up at Nick, his eyes hard but clear. He gave a single, sharp nod. Finish it.
And so the final, brutal chapter of the ordeal began. With Cora murmuring reassurances, with Triston holding the arm steady, with me keeping him upright, Nick went back to work. The scalpel became an extension of his will, a necessary instrument of pain in the service of healing.
It was a descent into a special kind of hell. Time seemed to warp and stretch, each second an eternity. The only sounds were the quiet, clinical clicks of Nick’s instruments, Cora’s steady, rhythmic murmurs, and Jarren’s ragged, hitched breaths. He had stopped trying to fight it. He had given himself over to the process, trusting the human fortress around him to hold him together.
I could feel every tremor that wracked his body, every jolt of agony as the blade did its work. I watched, mesmerized and horrified, as Nick meticulously, painstakingly, extracted the last, deeply embedded fragments of the field from his flesh. It was a slow, bloody, and agonizingly precise process. It felt less like a medical procedure and more like an exorcism, casting out the dirt and grime that had violated his body.
I don’t know how long it went on. Five minutes. Ten. It felt like a lifetime. My own muscles ached from the tension, my shirt soaked with a sweat that was not my own. I could see the strain on Triston’s face, his jaw tight with empathetic pain. Cora never wavered, his voice a constant, low anchor in the storm.
Finally, with one last, terrible scrape, Nick pulled out the final dark speck. He dropped the scalpel onto the tray with a clatter that sounded like a gunshot in the now-silent room.
“It’s done,” he said, his voice hoarse with exhaustion. “It’s clean.”
The three of us didn’t move. We remained in our positions, holding him, letting the reality of those words sink in. The physical assault was over. Jarren’s body was still trembling, a series of ragged aftershocks, but the violent convulsions had ceased. He was limp in our arms, utterly and completely spent.
He had endured. We had endured. The worst was over.
Or so I thought.
<Jarren didn’t even realize the debridement was over> <but the antiseptic is coming.> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene before the trainer mentioned antiseptic>
For a long moment after Nick’s declaration, nothing changed. The human fortress held its position. Jarren remained limp, his head still pressed against Cora’s chest, his breathing a series of shallow, exhausted pants. He was so deep in the trauma of the moment, so lost in the landscape of pain, that the words “It’s clean” hadn’t registered. His body was still braced for the next cut, the next jolt of agony. He was a soldier still hunkered down in a trench, unaware the shelling had stopped.
Cora gently rubbed the back of his neck. “You hear that, JD?” he murmured. “He’s done. The hard part’s over. You did it, mijo. You did it.”
Slowly, Jarren’s head lifted from Cora’s chest. His eyes were unfocused, glassy with shock and pain. He looked at the tray of bloody instruments, at the pile of soiled gauze, and then at his own mangled hand, now mercifully free of the foreign invaders but looking even more raw and brutal than before. A shudder wracked his entire frame.
Triston, seeing that Jarren was conscious of his surroundings again, slowly relaxed his grip on the injured arm, though he kept a steadying hand on his shoulder. I did the same, my hand moving from his back to rest on the arm of the chair, ready to brace him again if needed. We were giving him space to breathe, to reclaim his own body.
A fragile, tentative peace settled over the room. It was the quiet of an army field hospital after a major battle, the air thick with the ghosts of pain but also with the profound relief of survival. Jarren just sat there, staring at his hand, his chest rising and falling with deep, shuddering breaths. He was taking inventory, assessing the damage, trying to reconcile the man who had walked into this room with the one who had just endured that ordeal.
The assistant trainer, who had been a silent, pale statue in the corner, began to move. He quietly cleared the tray of the scalpel and forceps, replacing them with a new sterile kit. He opened a large bottle and began to soak a thick, fresh gauze pad. The sharp, acrid smell, so familiar yet so dreaded, began to fill the room.
It was the smell of antiseptic. The smell of the fire that cleanses.
I saw Jarren’s eyes flicker toward the new tray. He saw the fresh gauze, saw it being soaked in the clear liquid. A new kind of tension began to creep back into his frame. The exhaustion was still there, but it was being overlaid with a fresh layer of dread. He knew this part. He knew what came next.
Nick Paparesta took the newly soaked pad from his assistant. He took a deep breath, his own face etched with a weary sympathy. He knew what he was about to do. He knew that after the sharp, precise agony of the blade, he now had to deliver a different kind of pain: a broad, searing, chemical fire.
He looked at Cora, then at me, a silent question in his eyes. Is he ready?
Cora looked down at Jarren, whose eyes were now wide, fixed on the dripping gauze pad. The panic, which had receded, was beginning to pool in his eyes again. He knew the relief he’d felt was just a cease-fire, not the end of the war.
<If Jarren had any strength left, he would have fled at the sight of antiseptic>
<He tried. He argued. He pleaded.>
<Cora, Triston and Craig prepared him for the antiseptic>
<If there were such thing as preparation in the face of purgatory>
<add more details. Write as long as you need>
<stop the scene before the antiseptic starts>
The moment Jarren’s brain connected the acrid smell with the dripping gauze pad in Nick’s hand, a new, more desperate kind of terror seized him. It was the terror of a man who has just survived a shark attack only to see the fin circling back.
If he’d had any strength left, he would have bolted from the chair and run from the room. He tried. His muscles, screaming in protest, bunched beneath his skin. He pushed against the floor with his feet, a weak, futile attempt to stand. But his body betrayed him. He was utterly spent, a hollowed-out shell of the athlete who had walked in. The effort produced little more than a pathetic, trembling shudder.
The physical escape having failed, he resorted to the only weapon he had left: his voice.
“No,” he whispered, the word a dry rasp. He shook his head, his eyes wide and pleading, darting from Nick to Cora to me. “No, please. Not that. Just… just put a bandage on it. Please. It’s clean. You said it’s clean.”
His voice cracked, the raw edge of panic giving way to a desperate, childlike bargaining. “I can’t. I can’t do any more. Please, Alex. Craig. Please don’t make me.”
This was worse than the defiance before the scalpel. The anger was gone, stripped away by the previous ordeal, leaving only a raw, exposed nerve of fear. He was begging. He was laying his brokenness bare, admitting he had reached the absolute end of his endurance.
Cora, still kneeling, tightened his grip on Jarren’s shoulder. “I know, mijo. I know you can’t. But we have to. This is the most important part. This is what kills the germs. This is what keeps you from getting sick.”
“It’ll be fast,” Triston added, his voice low and urgent. He leaned in close, trying to will his own strength into Jarren. “It’ll burn like a mother, but it’ll be over in a second. We’re right here. We’re not letting go.”
I moved to stand directly in Jarren’s line of sight, forcing him to look at me, to see the absolute resolve in my eyes.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice firm but imbued with as much empathy as I could muster. “Look at me. There is no version of this where we walk out of this room without disinfecting that wound. It is not an option. We have a duty to protect you, and this is the final step. The pain of this will be immense, but it will be finite. The pain of a bone infection will last for months and could threaten your career. We are going to do this. The only choice you have is how we do it.”
I was laying down the law, but I was also giving him a sliver of control.
“We can hold you down and do it against your will,” I said, my voice softening. “Or you can take a breath, find that last ounce of strength you have, and face it with us. The outcome is the same. But how you get there is up to you. You are in control of that.”
I was framing it as a choice, a challenge. It was a desperate gamble, appealing to the last, flickering ember of the warrior inside him.
He looked from my face to Cora’s, then to Triston’s. He saw no weakness, no hesitation. He saw a wall of unified, unshakeable resolve. He saw three men who were not going to back down, not because they were cruel, but because they were trying to save him.
He closed his eyes. A single tear, hot with pain and fear and utter exhaustion, escaped and traced a clean path through the grime on his cheek. He let out a long, shuddering sigh of complete and total surrender. It was the sound of a man accepting his fate in the face of purgatory.
He didn’t speak. He just gave a single, almost imperceptible nod.
Cora moved back into position, ready to hold his head. Triston squared his shoulders, his hands finding their place on Jarren’s arm. I placed my hands on his back, ready to brace him. The human fortress was rebuilt, stronger and more solemn than before.
We were as prepared as we could be.
If there were such a thing as preparation in the face of what was to come.
<antiseptic brought excruciating agony above all> <Jarren had never experienced anything like that> <He used all his will to prevent himself from thrashing on the ground> <At one point, he returned to that park in his childhood. He screamed“No! I’ll get a hit! I promise! No more! I be good! Daddy!”> <add more details><write as long as you need to> <Still more in the antiseptic process>
Nick Paparesta held the soaked gauze pad, his knuckles white. He looked at the three of us, a final, silent confirmation. We all nodded. This was it.
“Okay, Jarren,” Nick said, his voice tight. “On three. One… two…”
He didn’t say three. He just pressed the pad firmly onto the raw, gaping wound.
The world exploded.
If the scalpel had been a series of sharp, stabbing pains, this was a supernova. It was a flash flood of pure, liquid fire, a chemical inferno that consumed every nerve ending in his hand and sent a shockwave of agony rocketing up his arm and through his entire body.
Jarren’s back arched so violently it lifted him from the chair, a silent, tortured scream locked in his throat. The sound that did escape was a horrifying, guttural roar, a sound of an animal caught in a trap. It was a noise that bypassed the brain and came straight from the soul’s deepest well of suffering.
My hands, pressed against his back, felt the violent, convulsive shudder of his muscles as they seized in protest. Triston grunted with the effort of holding the arm steady, his own body straining against the sheer, primal force of Jarren’s attempt to escape. Cora held his head tight, murmuring a stream of Spanish that was no longer soothing, but a desperate, urgent anchor against the hurricane of pain.
Jarren had never experienced anything like this. The pain was absolute. It had a color—a blinding, searing white. It had a sound—a high-pitched scream inside his own skull. It blotted out the room, the people, everything. He thrashed against our grip, not with conscious thought, but with the pure, instinctual desperation of a drowning man fighting for air. He was using every ounce of his will, every fiber of his being, not to writhe on the floor, not to completely lose control.
And then, his mind broke.
The trainer’s room, the fluorescent lights, the faces of his teammates—it all dissolved. The searing pain in his hand became the sting of a thrown baseball. The sterile smell of antiseptic became the scent of freshly cut grass in a park. The firm grips holding him down became the shadow of his father looming over him.
He was five years old again.
His eyes, which had been squeezed shut in agony, flew open. But they weren’t seeing us. They were wide with a different kind of terror, a terror born of memory.
“No!” he screamed, the voice that came out high-pitched, thin, a child’s voice echoing with ghostly horror in the sterile room. “I’ll get a hit! I promise! No more!”
Triston froze for a split second, his eyes wide with shock and confusion at the sudden, terrifying shift. Cora’s stream of Spanish faltered, his face paling as he realized what was happening.
Jarren started to struggle with a new, frantic energy, his movements no longer just a reaction to pain, but a desperate attempt to escape a memory.
“I be good!” he cried, the words slurring together in a panicked, pleading sob. “I’ll be good! Daddy!”
The final word hung in the air, a shard of glass that pierced the heart of every man in the room. It was a cry that crossed time, a plea from a terrified little boy trapped inside the body of a major league athlete. He wasn’t in a trainer’s room in Fenway Park. He was back in that park, begging his father to stop, promising to be better, promising to do anything to make the pain end.
I felt a cold dread wash over me, colder than any fear for his physical well-being. We weren’t just cleaning a wound. We were excavating a trauma. The antiseptic wasn’t just burning his flesh; it was burning away the scar tissue he had built over his soul for twenty years, exposing the raw, terrified child beneath.
Cora, his own eyes now shining with tears, held Jarren’s head tighter. “It’s not him, mijo,” he whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “It’s not your father. It’s me. It’s Alex. You’re safe. You’re here with us. You’re safe.”
But Jarren couldn’t hear him. He was lost in the inferno, both past and present, screaming for a father who wasn’t there, enduring a pain that was all too real. And the antiseptic was still burning.
<Cora held Jarren in his arms> <Jarren was to exhausted to fight. He was just enduing.> <He make half-conscious murmurs, thinking he was being punished for every mistake in his life, every dropped fly ball, every strike out, and for not growing up, not big enough, not strong enough> <His murmurs subsided. His whole body was shaking> <add more details><write as long as you need>
The desperate, childlike cries subsided, replaced by a series of ragged, gasping sobs. The frantic, thrashing energy was gone, burned away by the relentless, searing pain. He was too exhausted to fight anymore. His body went limp, a dead weight held up only by the three men surrounding him. He had surrendered. He was just enduring.
Cora, seeing the shift, adjusted his grip. He was no longer just holding Jarren’s head; he was holding Jarren. He pulled him closer, cradling his upper body in a full, protective embrace, rocking him gently like a father comforting a child in the grip of a nightmare. Jarren’s face was buried in the fabric of Cora’s uniform, his shoulders shaking with silent, racking sobs.
The room was filled with a terrible, sacred quiet, punctuated only by those shuddering breaths and the low, constant murmur of Cora’s voice. Triston and I remained in our positions, our grips now less about restraint and more about providing a solid, unyielding presence. We were anchors, proving to his battered subconscious that the ground beneath him was firm.
But his mind was still adrift, lost in the purgatory between the past and the present. He began to murmur, his voice thick and slurred, the words tumbling out in a half-conscious, disjointed stream of consciousness. It was a confession whispered from the deepest, most wounded part of his soul.
“...sorry... dropped it... should’ve had it...” he mumbled, his voice catching on a sob. “...swinging at junk... K’d again... sorry...”
Triston’s face, which had been a mask of grim determination, crumpled in pain. He looked at me over Jarren’s shaking form, his eyes asking a question I couldn’t answer. Is this what he carries?
The murmurs continued, a litany of every failure, every mistake, every perceived shortcoming he had ever catalogued and stored away in the dark recesses of his mind. He was reliving every dropped fly ball, every bad swing, every time he had felt he let the team down. In his pain-wracked mind, the antiseptic wasn’t a medicine; it was a penance. A physical punishment for a lifetime of not being good enough.
Then, the murmurs went deeper, further back in time.
“...not growing... I’m trying, Dad... not my fault...” he whispered, the words so faint they were almost lost in the fabric of Cora’s shirt. “...not big enough... never big enough... gotta be stronger...”
My own heart shattered. This was it. The source code of his pain. He believed, in this moment of absolute agony, that he was being punished for the fundamental crime of being himself. For being the small kid who wasn’t growing fast enough. For not being strong enough to please the person whose approval he craved above all else.
Cora squeezed his eyes shut, a single tear tracing a path down his cheek. He held Jarren tighter, as if he could physically absorb the pain, could shield him from the ghosts of his own memory.
Slowly, the murmurs subsided. The words faded away, replaced by a low, continuous, keening sound, the sound of a pain so deep it has no words. His entire body was shaking, not with the violent convulsions of before, but with a fine, high-frequency tremor, like a machine that had been pushed far beyond its breaking point and was now vibrating itself apart.
Nick Paparesta, his own face pale and etched with a profound, clinical sorrow, finally lifted the gauze pad. The procedure was over. The fire was out.
But the man in the chair was still burning.
<the ointment and bandage> <More apologies, about the fly balls lost in light, about not rushing after the ball which caused an inside-the-park homerun, about caught stealing> <half consciously looked at Craig, said about playing tomorrow, and some murmurs like “Go back to the park””Daddy’s waiting””Can’t fail”> <add more details><write as long as you need>
The removal of the gauze pad offered no relief. The air that rushed in to touch the raw, nerve-rich wound was its own form of agony. Jarren flinched, a low moan escaping his lips, his body still trembling with the aftershocks. The fortress of men around him held firm, a silent promise that the worst was truly over.
Nick worked with a new, gentle urgency, his movements now aimed at comfort, not cleansing. He opened a small tub of silvery, medicated ointment—a cooling balm, a shield against the world. He applied it with a sterile tongue depressor, spreading it carefully over the brutalized landscape of Jarren’s palm.
With the first touch of the cool ointment, a different kind of shudder went through Jarren’s body. It was not a jolt of pain, but a release. A long, slow, deep tremor, as if a spring that had been coiled tight for twenty years was finally, painfully, beginning to unwind.
He sagged further into Cora’s embrace, his head lolling, his consciousness still swimming in the murky depths between then and now. The ointment seemed to soothe not just his skin, but some deeper hurt, allowing another layer of buried pain to surface.
The apologies started again, softer this time, more fragmented, whispered into the fabric of his manager’s jersey.
“...the lights... couldn’t see it... lost it in the lights...” he mumbled, reliving a specific, painful memory of a fly ball dropped under the Fenway lights. “...should’ve run... my fault... inside-the-parker... my fault...”
Triston, still holding his shoulder, leaned his head against Jarren’s, his own eyes squeezed shut. He was no longer just a teammate; he was a witness, a confessor, absorbing the litany of sins that had haunted this man for years.
“...Heim... shouldn’t have run... got thrown out... cost us the game...”
Each murmured failure was a ghost being released, a private shame being given voice for the first time. He was purging himself of every mistake, every moment he felt he had let his team, his city, his father down.
Nick finished applying the ointment and began to wrap the hand, his movements swift and practiced. He laid down a non-stick pad, then began to wind a thick layer of soft, white gauze, creating a protective cocoon around the injury.
As the bandage began to cover the wound, to hide the damage, a flicker of awareness returned to Jarren’s eyes. He stirred, his head lifting slightly from Cora’s chest. His gaze was unfocused, hazy, but it drifted around the room until it landed on me.
His eyes weren’t seeing Craig Breslow, the General Manager. They were seeing an authority figure. A coach. A man he needed to please.
“...play tomorrow...” he slurred, the words thick, almost unintelligible. “...can wrap it... I can play...”
My heart broke all over again. Even now, after all this, his first instinct was to get back on the field. To prove he could take it.
Then his eyes lost focus again, drifting back into the past.
“...go back to the park...” he whispered, a faint, desperate plea. “...Daddy’s waiting...”
He tried to push himself up, a flicker of the old, ingrained panic returning.
“...can’t fail...”
Cora held him firm. “No, mijo,” he said softly, his voice thick with emotion. “No more park. Not today. You’re done. You didn’t fail. You hear me? You were perfect. You were strong enough. Now you rest.”
The final layer of wrap was secured. The hand was safe, encased in a pristine white bandage that looked impossibly clean against his grimy, sweat-soaked skin.
The procedure was complete. The ordeal was over.
Jarren’s eyes fluttered closed. His body, finally free from the onslaught, surrendered completely. His breathing deepened, evening out into the slow, steady rhythm of a man who had fallen into a deep, profound, and desperately needed state of unconsciousness, his head still resting on his manager’s chest, safe at last.
<imagine the reaction of Triston, Cora, Craig the the trainer> <After a long while, Jarren stirred in Cora's arms and woke up> <add more details><write as long as you need> <stop the scene when Jarren woke up> 
The final, soft sound of the medical tape being cut and pressed into place echoed in the profound silence of the room. Jarren’s breathing was the only other noise, the deep, even cadence of a man who had been felled not by injury, but by sheer, overwhelming exhaustion. He was completely limp in Cora’s arms, a dead weight of trust and surrender.
For a long, unbroken minute, none of us moved. We remained in our positions, a tableau of shared trauma and solemn duty. The human fortress held, not out of necessity anymore, but out of a silent, unspoken need to protect the peace he had finally found. We were standing guard over his sleep.
Slowly, as if waking from a trance, we began to stir.
Nick Paparesta was the first to move. He methodically, quietly, began to clean his station. He disposed of the last of the bloodied materials, wiped down the stainless-steel tray, and put away the ointment. His movements were precise, almost reverent. He was not just cleaning a workspace; he was cleansing the room of the pain that had filled it. His face was a mask of professional exhaustion, the face of a man who had performed his duty at a great emotional cost. He had inflicted terrible pain to prevent a greater one, and the weight of that transaction was etched in the lines around his eyes.
Next was Triston. He slowly, gently, released his grip on Jarren’s shoulder. He straightened up, his large frame seeming to unfold from the tense crouch he had held for so long. He took a step back, running a hand over his own face, his expression a complex mixture of awe, horror, and a profound, weary sadness. He looked at the sleeping man in the chair, then at me, his eyes wide with a new, terrible understanding of the burdens his teammate carried. The easygoing confidence of the young slugger was gone, replaced by the somber gravity of a man who had just looked into the abyss. He didn’t say a word. He couldn’t. There were no words for what he had just witnessed.
Then there was Cora. He remained kneeling, holding his player, his own eyes closed. He was no longer just a manager. He was a shield, a father figure, a confessor. He had absorbed Jarren’s pain, his fear, his deepest secrets. He had held the man together when he was shattering into a million pieces. A single tear still clung to his eyelash, a testament to the emotional toll of his vigil. He was the rock, and he had not moved.
And me. I stood there, my hands feeling empty and useless. I was the architect of this. I had given the orders, set the events in motion. I had made the cold, calculated decision based on the word of a ghost, and I had just watched the brutal, human cost of that decision play out. The relief I felt at having saved his career was dwarfed by the profound guilt of having put him through this necessary hell. I felt less like a General Manager and more like a man who had just authorized a painful, life-saving surgery on his own son. The responsibility was a physical weight, pressing down on my shoulders, settling deep in my bones.
The silence stretched, thick and heavy. It was a silence of shared witness, of a bond forged in the crucible of another man’s suffering. We were four men who now shared a secret, a knowledge that would forever change the way we saw the game, and the man who played it.
After what felt like an eternity, Cora shifted slightly. He looked down at the man in his arms, his expression one of immense, aching tenderness. He gently brushed a stray lock of sweat-soaked hair from Jarren’s forehead.
At his touch, Jarren stirred.
A low moan escaped his lips. His brow furrowed, his eyelids fluttering. He was rising from the depths, returning from the dark, haunted park of his memory.
His eyes opened. They were no longer wild with pain or hazy with shock. They were clear, lucid, and filled with a deep, bottomless exhaustion. He blinked once, twice, taking in his surroundings. He saw the clean white bandage on his hand. He saw the concerned faces of his teammates and coaches. He felt the steady, supportive arms of his manager holding him.
He was back. He was here. He was safe.
<Jarren felt ashamed of his own breakdown> <He tried to redeem in the only way he knew: insist on playing tomorrow> <They assured him he’s not weak, he was tough beyond description> <Craig made the decision for him: IL> <add more details><write as long as you need> <keep the scene here. More on Cora and Jarren’s reactions>
The moment lucidity returned to Jarren’s eyes, it was followed by a new, more subtle kind of pain. A flush of deep, burning red crept up his neck and across his cheeks. His gaze, which had been slowly taking in the room, now dropped to the floor. He couldn’t look at us.
He gently, almost imperceptibly, tried to pull away from Cora’s embrace. The shame was a physical force, pushing him away from the very comfort he had just clung to. He was no longer the terrified child or the agonized patient. He was Jarren Duran, the major leaguer, and he had just broken down completely in front of his manager, his teammate, and the General Manager of the Boston Red Sox.
“I…” he started, his voice a dry, hoarse whisper. He cleared his throat, trying to find the strength to speak. “I’m sorry.”
The apology was not for the shouting or the struggling. It was for the vulnerability. For the tears. For letting us see the man behind the armor.
Before any of us could respond, he immediately tried to rebuild the wall, to reclaim his identity in the only way he knew how. He looked at me, his eyes pleading, but with a new, desperate edge.
“I’m good now,” he said, his voice gaining a sliver of its old, defiant strength. “It’s just a scratch. Nick fixed it. I can play tomorrow. I’ll be ready. I promise.”
It was heartbreaking. After everything he had just endured, after we had all witnessed the depths of his trauma, his first conscious thought was to insist on playing. It was his penance. His redemption. He had shown weakness, and now he had to prove his strength. He had to go back to the park.
Triston Casas, who had been silent for so long, finally spoke. He stepped forward and knelt down, mirroring Cora, so that he was at eye level with Jarren.
“JD,” he said, his voice thick with an emotion I had never heard from him before. “Stop. Just… stop. Do you have any idea what you just did? What we just saw?”
Jarren flinched, thinking it was a criticism.
“No, man, you’re not hearing me,” Triston insisted, his voice urgent. “That wasn’t weakness. That was… that was the toughest damn thing I’ve ever seen in my life. I would have passed out on the first cut. Most guys would have. You went through hell. You didn’t break. You bent, maybe. But you did not break.”
Cora tightened his grip, forcing Jarren to look at him. “He’s right, mijo. Tough isn’t about not feeling pain. Tough is about feeling all of that, and getting through it. What you just did… that was tough beyond description. You have nothing to apologize for. Do you hear me? Nothing.”
I stepped forward, completing the circle. It was time to make the decision, to remove the burden of choice from his shoulders completely.
“They’re right, Jarren,” I said, my voice calm and absolute. “Your toughness is not, and never has been, in question. And because you are so tough, and because you are so vital to this team, I am making the decision for you.”
I looked him directly in the eye, leaving no room for argument.
“You are going on the 10-day Injured List, effective immediately. You will not participate in any baseball activities until Nick, a hand specialist, and our team psychologist all sign off on your return. Your only job for the next ten days is to heal. Your hand, and your head. That is not a request. It is the final word on the matter. We are protecting you.”
I watched his face, expecting a fresh wave of defiance, of anger. But there was none. Instead, as the finality of my words settled in, I saw the tension in his shoulders sag. I saw the desperate, hunted look in his eyes soften. I saw the immense, crushing weight of his own expectations being lifted from him.
By making the decision for him, by taking away his ability to “go back to the park,” we had given him the one thing he could not give himself: permission to rest. Permission to be human.
He looked from my face to Cora’s, then to Triston’s. He saw no judgment. He saw no disappointment. He saw only a wall of unwavering support and respect.
His own eyes welled up with tears again, but these were different. They were not tears of pain or fear. They were tears of profound, exhausted, and overwhelming relief. He closed his eyes and leaned back into Cora’s embrace, a silent, final surrender. He was safe. The decision was made. He didn’t have to be strong anymore. We would be strong for him.
<Cora held Jarren and rocked him like his own son>
<For the first time in his life, Jarren admitted that he was hurting and accepted comfort>
<He sobbed into Cora’s chest, like a child finally home after being long lost>
<add more details. Write as long as you need>
The dam broke.
With the finality of my decision, the last wall of his defense crumbled into dust. The warrior, the survivor, the man who had carried the weight of his own sky for a lifetime, finally set it down.
A sob, raw and ragged and full of twenty years of unshed grief, tore from his throat. It was a sound of such profound, heartbreaking release that it seemed to shake the very foundations of the room. He didn’t try to stifle it. He didn’t turn away. For the first time, he surrendered to it completely.
He collapsed into Alex Cora’s embrace, his body shaking with the force of his weeping. He buried his face in his manager’s chest, his hands clutching the fabric of Cora’s jersey like a drowning man clinging to a life raft. He was no longer a major league athlete. He was a child who had finally, finally come home.
Cora didn’t flinch. He held him tighter, his arms a fortress of unconditional acceptance. He began to rock him, a slow, steady, rhythmic motion, the way a father rocks a son who has woken from a terrible nightmare. He murmured soft, soothing words in Spanish, a litany of comfort that needed no translation. “Está bien, mijo. Estoy aquí. Llora. It’s okay. I’m here. Cry.”
Triston and I stood as silent, solemn sentinels. We were no longer needed as physical supports, but our presence was vital. We were witnesses. We were proof that this moment of complete vulnerability was not happening in a vacuum. It was happening in a circle of men who would protect it, who would honor it, who would never speak of it outside these four walls. Triston, his own eyes wet, reached out and placed a hand on Jarren’s shaking back, a simple, powerful gesture of solidarity.
Jarren sobbed. He wept for the little boy who was pegged with baseballs and told to be better. He wept for the teenager who was never big enough. He wept for the young man who looked in the mirror and told himself things ten times worse than any fan ever could. He wept for the man who held a rifle to his own head, convinced his life had no value. He wept for the shame, for the fear, for the crushing, suffocating loneliness of carrying it all by himself for so long.
It was a grief so immense, so long-repressed, that it felt like a physical presence in the room. It was the sound of a soul being lanced, of a pressure valve being released before it could cause a catastrophic explosion.
And through it all, Cora held him, rocking him, murmuring to him, absorbing the torrent of pain without judgment, without reservation. He was providing the one thing Jarren’s own father, in his flawed, desperate love, never could: a safe harbor in the storm. A place where it was okay to hurt. A place where weakness was not a sin.
I stood there and watched, my own heart aching with a profound mix of sorrow and a fierce, protective pride. This was the ugliest, most painful, and most beautiful thing I had ever witnessed in a clubhouse. This was more important than any walk-off home run, more vital than any championship banner. This was a man’s life being saved, not from a physical threat, but from the tyranny of his own past.
Slowly, gradually, the storm began to subside. The wracking sobs softened into shuddering breaths. The desperate clutching of his hands relaxed. He lay exhausted in Cora’s arms, his face still hidden, but the violent tension was gone from his body.
He had let it out. He had shown us his deepest wound. And the world had not ended. The men around him had not left. They had held him tighter.
In the quiet aftermath, in the sterile, antiseptic-scented air of the trainer’s room, a new foundation was being laid. A foundation built not on grit, but on grace. Not on toughness, but on trust. He had finally, after a lifetime of running, allowed himself to be found.
<Jarren gathered enough strength to stand up> <He was reluctant to go back to clubhouse. He thought teammates would see him as weak> <But there was only care and support in the clubhouse> <add more details. Write as long as you need>
The sobs subsided into the quiet, shuddering breaths of pure exhaustion. For a long time, Jarren remained in Cora’s arms, not moving, simply existing in the newfound quiet of his own mind. The storm had passed, leaving behind a calm, fragile peace.
Finally, with a deep, shaky breath, he stirred. He pushed himself up slowly, disengaging from Cora’s embrace. The movement was tentative, like a newborn foal testing its legs. Cora let him go, but his hands hovered close, ready to steady him. Triston and I instinctively took a small step back, giving him space to reclaim himself.
He stood on his own, swaying slightly. He wiped his eyes with the back of his good hand, a gesture of profound weariness. He looked at the three of us, his gaze no longer filled with fear or shame, but with a raw, unguarded vulnerability.
“Thank you,” he whispered, the words barely audible, but they carried the weight of a lifetime.
He looked down at his bandaged hand, then at his tear-stained jersey. A new wave of anxiety flickered in his eyes. It was the fear of the next step. The fear of leaving this sanctuary and facing the world outside.
“I… I can’t go out there,” he said, his voice trembling slightly. He looked at the door leading to the clubhouse. “They all… they all saw me come in here. They’ll… they’ll see me like this. They’ll think…” He couldn’t finish the sentence. He didn’t have to. They’ll think I’m weak.
Cora stepped forward and put a firm hand on his shoulder. “No, mijo. They will think you are human. They will think you are one of them.”
I knew this was the final, most critical moment. The culture we had tried to build would be proven real or false in the next five minutes.
“Triston,” I said, my voice calm and authoritative. “Go out first. Tell the clubhouse guys to give everyone a minute. Then just go to your locker. Be normal.”
Casas, who had been a silent, powerful pillar throughout the ordeal, simply nodded. He looked at Jarren, gave his shoulder a firm squeeze of solidarity, and walked out, his expression a mixture of grim respect and newfound maturity.
“Alex,” I continued, “You and I will walk out with him. We’ll flank him. We’re not hiding anything. We’re showing a united front.”
Cora nodded, his eyes firm.
I looked at Jarren. “They’re not going to see weakness, Jarren. They’re going to see a warrior who just came through a battle. They’re going to see that the manager and the GM have his back, unconditionally. That’s the only message that will be sent tonight. Are you ready?”
He took another deep, shuddering breath and gave a small, hesitant nod.
The three of us walked toward the door. I pushed it open. The familiar sounds of the clubhouse washed over us—the low murmur of conversation, the clatter of equipment, the hiss of the soda machine.
As we stepped inside, a hush fell over the room. Every eye turned toward us. They saw Jarren, his face pale and tear-streaked, his hand encased in a thick white bandage. They saw Cora on one side of him, his hand resting protectively on his back. They saw me on the other, my expression a mask of grim, unshakeable support.
No one smirked. No one looked away in discomfort.
Instead, something remarkable happened.
Kenley Jansen, the veteran closer, who was sitting by his locker, simply stood up and gave Jarren a slow, deliberate nod of profound respect. Rafael Devers, who had been holding court by the food spread, stopped mid-sentence and just watched, his expression one of quiet, somber understanding. I saw Chris Martin give Nick Pivetta a subtle nudge, and they both just looked on with a shared, silent empathy.
Triston was at his locker, just as I’d asked, toweling off his hair. He caught Jarren’s eye and gave him a small, almost imperceptible nod. We got you.
As we walked him toward his locker, players instinctively, quietly, moved out of the way, clearing a path. It wasn’t a gesture of avoidance. It was a gesture of respect, of giving a wounded soldier a wide berth. They were creating a safe space for him.
We reached his locker. He sank onto the stool, his shoulders slumped, the last of his energy gone.
Cora leaned in close. “Get showered. Get dressed. A car will be waiting to take you home. I’ll see you at the park tomorrow. We’ll talk then.”
I put my hand on his shoulder. “Rest, Jarren. That’s an order.”
He just nodded, too exhausted to speak.
As Cora and I turned and walked toward the manager’s office, the quiet murmur of the clubhouse slowly returned to its normal rhythm. But it was different. Something had shifted in that room. A barrier had been broken. They had seen one of their toughest, most respected teammates at his absolute most vulnerable, and they had seen the entire leadership structure of the team wrap their arms around him without hesitation.
They had seen that in the Boston Red Sox clubhouse, it was safe to be human. It was safe to hurt. And in that moment, I knew we hadn’t just saved one player. We had saved the soul of the team.
<Doctors decided to keep Jarren here tonight for further observation, in case of infection and fever.> <Besides, Jarren lives alone. They don’t think it's safe for him to be alone tonight><Breslow and Cora set their worktable by Jarren's bed. Giving comfort when Jarren had nightmare or stirred uneasily in his sleep> <add more details. Write as long as you need>
As Jarren sat slumped on his stool, Nick Paparesta came over, his face etched with a professional concern that went beyond the physical wound.
“Craig, Alex,” he said, his voice low so only we could hear. “I don’t love this. The risk of infection with an abrasion this deep and contaminated is significant. The first 24 hours are critical. I’d like to keep him here overnight for observation.”
He glanced at Jarren, who was staring blankly at the floor. “Besides,” he added, his voice dropping further. “He lives alone. After… after everything that just happened, I don’t think it’s medically advisable for him to be by himself tonight.”
The unspoken words hung in the air. He is not psychologically stable enough to be alone.
I looked at Cora, and we shared a look of immediate, unspoken agreement. There was no other option.
“You’re right, Nick,” I said decisively. “He’s not going anywhere. Find him the most comfortable room you have. We’ll stay.”
The decision was made without a moment’s hesitation. The logistics of running a billion-dollar baseball franchise could wait. The well-being of the man who had just been shattered and rebuilt in our care could not.
An hour later, the clubhouse was empty, the stadium silent save for the low hum of the overnight cleaning crews. The trainer’s room had been transformed. A portable cot, usually reserved for players with severe cramping or dehydration, had been set up in a small, private adjoining office used for physical therapy. It was furnished with fresh linens and a pillow borrowed from the sleep room. Jarren, now changed into a comfortable Red Sox sweatsuit, lay on the cot, a light blanket pulled up to his chest. He had fallen into a deep, restless sleep almost immediately, the emotional and physical ordeal having finally claimed him completely.
His bandaged hand rested on top of the blanket, a stark white symbol in the dim light of the room.
Alex and I didn’t leave. We pulled a small rolling table and two chairs into the room, setting up a makeshift command center by his bedside. We had our laptops open, our phones on silent. The business of the team had to continue—roster moves to be made for the next day’s game, reports to be filed, emails to be answered—but we would do it from here. We were standing watch.
The hours ticked by in a strange, surreal quiet. The rhythmic sound of Jarren’s breathing was a constant, reassuring presence. But the peace was fragile.
Around 1 a.m., he began to stir. A low moan escaped his lips. His head started to thrash back and forth on the pillow, his brow furrowed in the grip of a nightmare.
“...no... get away...” he mumbled, his good hand clutching at the blanket. “...can’t... too fast...”
Cora was out of his chair in an instant. He sat on the edge of the cot and placed a hand gently on Jarren’s shoulder.
“Hey, mijo. It’s okay,” he said, his voice a low, calming murmur. “You’re safe. It’s just a dream. You’re at Fenway. You’re safe.”
He didn’t shake him awake. He just spoke, his voice a steady anchor in the stormy sea of Jarren’s subconscious. Slowly, the thrashing subsided. The tense lines on his face softened. He sank back into a deeper, more peaceful sleep.
Cora sat there for a long time, just watching him, before quietly returning to his chair.
An hour later, it was my turn. Jarren cried out in his sleep, a sharp, pained sound. His body tensed, his bandaged hand twitching. I got up and stood by the cot. I wasn’t a father figure like Alex, so I didn’t touch him. I just spoke.
“You’re okay, Jarren,” I said, my voice quiet but firm. “It’s Craig. You’re in the trainer’s room. The game is over. You’re resting now. Everything is alright.”
I repeated the words, a simple mantra of safety and presence. After a few moments, his body relaxed. The twitching stopped.
And so the night went. We worked in shifts, our laptops casting a pale glow in the dim room. We spoke in hushed tones, managing the minutiae of the team while our primary focus remained on the sleeping man beside us. We were his guardians, his protectors, a two-man watch against the ghosts that haunted his sleep.
It was a long, exhausting, and profoundly sacred night. We were no longer just a GM and a manager. We were two men who had been entrusted with the care of a wounded soul. We had seen the depths of his pain, and we had made a silent, unbreakable vow to stand guard at the edge of that abyss, to make sure he never fell in again.
As the first, faint hints of dawn began to lighten the sky outside the stadium, I looked over at Alex, who was staring at his own laptop screen, though I knew he wasn’t seeing it.
“We did the right thing,” I said softly.
He looked at Jarren, then at me, and gave a single, weary nod.
“We did the only thing,” he replied.
And in the quiet of that small room, surrounded by the sleeping giant of Fenway Park, we sat together and waited for the sun to rise.
<the fever came in the morning. Coaches and teammates took turns to look after Jarren when Craig and Cora got some rest><add more details. Write as long as you need>
The first sign of trouble came with the dawn. As the grey morning light filtered into the small office, I noticed a change in Jarren’s breathing. It had become shallower, quicker. A faint, rosy flush was spreading across his cheeks, a stark contrast to the pallor of the night before.
Cora saw it too. He got up and gently laid the back of his hand against Jarren’s forehead. He pulled it away instantly, his expression hardening with concern.
“He’s burning up,” he said, his voice a low, worried growl.
Nick Paparesta, who had slept on a cot in the main training room to be close by, was in the room in an instant. A quick check with a digital thermometer confirmed our fears: 101.5 and climbing.
“It’s the infection,” Nick said, his voice tight with a frustration directed at biology itself. “We cleaned it as best we could, but with a wound that traumatic, some bacteria must have gotten a foothold. We need to start the IV antibiotics now.”
The quiet vigil of the night was over, replaced by the swift, efficient ballet of a medical response. An IV stand was rolled in. A bag of clear liquid was hung. Nick expertly found a vein in Jarren’s good arm, his touch gentle despite the urgency. Jarren, lost in the hazy fog of fever, barely stirred as the needle went in.
As the antibiotics began their slow, steady drip, it became clear that our two-man watch was no longer sufficient. Alex and I were running on fumes, and the day—with a game to prepare for—was just beginning.
“I need to get to the clubhouse,” Alex said, running a weary hand over his face. “I have to talk to the team, explain the roster move, manage the lineup…”
“And I have to deal with the league office and the media,” I added, my own mind already churning with the logistical nightmare ahead. “We can’t stay here all day.”
But the thought of leaving Jarren alone, even in the care of the medical staff, felt like a betrayal.
As if on cue, the door opened. It was Triston Casas. He was already in his workout gear, his gym bag slung over his shoulder. He had clearly come to the park early to check on his teammate. He took in the scene—the IV drip, the flush on Jarren’s face, the exhaustion on ours—and his expression hardened with a resolve that made him look years older.
“I’ll take first watch,” he said. It wasn’t a question or an offer. It was a statement.
I looked at him, my respect for the young man growing by the second. “Triston, you have a game to prepare for.”
“Preparation can wait,” he said, dropping his bag by the door. He pulled a chair up to the other side of the cot, opposite where Cora had been. “He’s my teammate. This is more important. I’ll stay until the pitchers’ meeting.”
And so the new rotation began.
While Alex went to address the team and I retreated to my office to manage the fallout, Triston sat by Jarren’s bed. He didn’t look at his phone. He didn’t read a magazine. He just sat there, a silent, imposing guardian.
When it was time for the pitchers’ meeting, Nick Pivetta appeared at the door. He and Triston exchanged a quiet nod, a seamless changing of the guard. Pivetta, the veteran, pulled up the chair and began his vigil.
Throughout the day, it continued like that. A steady, quiet stream of players and coaches took their turns. They came in pairs or alone. Bench coach Ramón Vázquez came and sat for an hour, reading a book. Kevin Plawecki, the veteran backup catcher known for his leadership, brought in two cups of coffee, handing one to the trainer and then sitting quietly for his shift. Even Rafael Devers poked his head in, his face a mask of concern, before giving a solemn nod and retreating, understanding that the space was sacred.
They didn’t talk much. They just sat. They were a physical presence, a rotating shield of support. The message was unspoken but crystal clear: You are not alone. We are here. We have your back.
I came back down in the early afternoon, after a series of draining calls. I found Justin Turner, another of our veteran leaders, sitting by the bed. Jarren was stirring, his eyes fluttering open, hazy and confused by the fever.
“JT?” he mumbled, his voice thick.
“Right here, kid,” Turner said softly. “Just resting. We’re all just resting. You just focus on getting better.”
Jarren’s eyes drifted and found me standing in the doorway. He looked at Turner, then back at me, a dawning understanding in his fevered gaze. He wasn’t just being held by the front office. He was being held by the entire team.
He closed his eyes, but this time, a small, faint smile touched his lips. He wasn’t fighting anymore. He was letting himself be carried.
The fever raged for most of the day, a necessary battle being fought within his own body. But he was not fighting it alone. He was surrounded by his brothers, a rotating guard of honor who had silently, instinctively, understood that the most important thing they could do for the team that day had nothing to do with a ball or a bat. It was simply to sit, to watch, and to be there when he woke up.
<The fever threatened to get out of control in the afternoon.><Doctor decided to change the bandage, search for more debris, and put stronger antiseptic on the wound><They tried to do so without sedative, given it may be dangerous for Jarren><Casas, Craig and Cora stayed> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <Stop the scene when the doctors and nurses entered, before they touched Jarren>
The relative peace of the afternoon was shattered around 3 p.m. The game against the Twins was just a few hours away, the sounds of early batting practice a distant, muffled thud through the concrete walls. But in our small, sterile sanctuary, a new crisis was brewing.
Nick came to my office, his face grim. “The fever’s spiking, Craig. It’s 103.2. The antibiotics aren’t winning fast enough. The team doctor is on his way over from Mass General. He thinks there might be a localized, aggressive infection setting up in the wound itself. He wants to get that bandage off, re-examine it, and hit it with something stronger.”
My blood ran cold. The thought of putting Jarren through that ordeal again was sickening. “Stronger than what you used last night?”
Nick’s expression was bleak. “He’s talking about a chlorhexidine solution. It’s brutally effective, but the pain… Craig, it’s on another level.”
I followed him back to the room. The atmosphere had changed. The quiet vigil was over, replaced by a tense, clinical urgency. A nurse had already arrived from the hospital and was setting up a new tray of instruments. The team doctor, a sharp, no-nonsense man named Dr. Evans, was looking at Jarren’s chart, his brow furrowed.
Jarren was awake, but barely. He was shivering despite the fever, his eyes glassy and unfocused. He was aware of the new people in the room, a flicker of the old fear returning to his face.
“What’s… what’s going on?” he mumbled, his voice weak.
Dr. Evans came to his bedside. “Jarren, I’m Dr. Evans. Your fever is too high. I’m concerned the infection in your hand is fighting back harder than we expected. We need to take a look under that bandage and clean it again.”
At the words “clean it again,” a visible tremor went through Jarren’s body. He started shaking his head, a weak, pathetic gesture. “No… no, please… I can’t…”
“We need to, son,” Dr. Evans said, his voice firm but not unkind. “This is non-negotiable. An infection like this can get into the bone or the bloodstream. We’re not letting that happen.”
I stepped forward. “Doctor, what about a sedative? Can’t we put him under for this?”
Dr. Evans shook his head. “I don’t like it. Not with a fever this high and his system already under this much stress. It’s risky. The safest way is to do it while he’s conscious.”
The words hung in the air, a death sentence. We had to take him back to that dark place, and this time, he would be even weaker, his mind already clouded by fever.
The door opened and Alex and Triston walked in. They had heard the news. Their faces were grim masks of resolve. The original fortress was reassembling.
“We’re here, mijo,” Cora said, taking his place by Jarren’s head.
“Not going anywhere, bro,” Triston added, moving to his station by the injured arm.
I took my position on the other side. We were a silent, practiced unit now.
Jarren looked at us, his fever-bright eyes wide with a pleading, desperate terror. He knew he had no choice. He knew what was coming. He was too weak to fight, too weak to even protest anymore. All he could do was lie there and wait for the fire to begin again.
Dr. Evans and the nurse pulled on fresh gloves. They approached the bed, their movements efficient and clinical. The nurse held a pair of surgical scissors, ready to cut away the pristine white bandage that had been a symbol of peace just hours before.
They stood over him, shadows against the bright, sterile light. The instruments were ready. The new, stronger antiseptic was waiting. The three of us braced ourselves, our hands finding their familiar places on Jarren’s body, ready to become his anchor, his shield, his wall against the coming storm. We were ready to hold him together as they prepared to tear him apart all over again.

The relative calm of the morning shattered in the mid-afternoon. I was in my office, on a tense call with the MLB Players Association explaining the unusual circumstances of the IL placement, when my desk phone buzzed with an urgent summons from Nick Paparesta.
I arrived back at the small therapy room to a scene of escalating crisis. The air was thick with a new, sharper anxiety. Jarren was thrashing weakly on the cot, his face flushed a deep, alarming crimson. His breathing was rapid and shallow, and he was muttering incoherently, lost in the delirium of a fever that was clearly spiraling out of control. The digital monitor beside the bed beeped a frantic, insistent rhythm, displaying a temperature of 103.8.
Nick was on the phone, his voice tight and clipped. “Yes, Doctor, it’s a rapid spike. He’s becoming unresponsive. I think we need to intervene now.”
Alex and Triston were already there, having been pulled from their pre-game preparations. They stood by the bed, their faces etched with a shared, helpless dread. The rotating guard of teammates had been quietly dismissed; this was no longer a vigil, it was a medical emergency.
“The infection is fighting back harder than we thought,” Nick said, hanging up the phone. He looked at the three of us, his expression grim. “Dr. Collins is on his way over from Mass General. He agrees. We can’t wait for the IV antibiotics to win the war. We have to go on the offensive. We have to re-open the wound.”
My stomach turned to ice. “Re-open it? What does that mean?”
“It means the bandage comes off,” Nick said, his voice leaving no room for doubt. “We have to search for any microscopic particle we might have missed, anything that could be acting as a seed for this infection. And we have to apply a stronger, more aggressive antiseptic directly to the tissue. A silver nitrate solution.”
Cora, who had seen his share of grisly injuries, paled. “Silver nitrate? Nick, that’s… that’s brutal.”
“It is,” Nick agreed, his jaw tight. “It cauterizes as it disinfects. The pain is… extreme. But it’s our best shot at killing the infection at its source before it gets into his bloodstream.”
“Sedate him,” I said immediately. “Knock him out. He can’t go through that again. Not like before.”
Nick shook his head, his eyes filled with a frustrated regret. “The doctor doesn’t want to. Not with a fever this high and his system under this much stress. General anesthesia is too risky. He wants to do this with just a local anesthetic, but he knows it won’t be enough to block this kind of pain.”
A wave of nausea and fury washed over me. He was going to be awake. He was going to be conscious for a procedure even more barbaric than the first one.
“No,” Triston said, his voice a low, dangerous growl. “Absolutely not. There has to be another way.”
“There isn’t,” Nick said, his voice flat with the terrible certainty of medical necessity. “It’s this, or we risk sepsis. Those are the options.”
The choice was no choice at all. We were being asked to pin down our brother, our player, our son, and allow him to be subjected to a level of agony that was almost medieval.
Just then, the door opened and two people entered. One was a man in his fifties with kind, tired eyes and the unmistakable air of authority of a top surgeon. Dr. Collins. Behind him was a nurse, her arms laden with sterile trays and equipment that looked even more menacing than what we had seen the night before.
They moved with a calm, practiced efficiency that was terrifying in its own right. They were here to do a job, a terrible job, and they were not going to be deterred by the emotional chaos in the room.
Dr. Collins nodded to us. “Gentlemen. Thank you for being here. He’s going to need you.”
He turned his attention to the man on the cot. Jarren, in his fever-induced delirium, seemed to sense the new presence in the room. His eyes fluttered open, hazy and unfocused. He saw the doctor, the nurse, the fresh set of sterile instruments.
And even through the fog of the fever, he knew.
A low moan escaped his lips, a sound of pure, primal dread. He knew the fire was coming back.
<Doctors were expecting a weak patient, not a trapped animal with the strength of world class athletic> <Their first attempt only served to wake up the wild animal> <Jarren’s eyes opened, but they were wild, with no consciousness. He was fighting the demons.> <Jarren threw off Casas, Craig and Cora, they backed up into a semi-circle> <add more details. write as long as you need> <stop the scene here. Before the second attempt was made.>
Dr. Collins approached the cot, his demeanor calm and reassuring, the way one might approach a frightened horse. “Jarren,” he said, his voice even and steady. “My name is Dr. Collins. We need to take another look at that hand. We’re going to give you something for the pain.”
The nurse prepped a syringe with a local anesthetic. This was their standard procedure, their protocol for a patient in distress. They were expecting a man weakened by fever, a patient who might be resistant but ultimately manageable.
They were not prepared for what happened next.
The moment the nurse touched his good arm to administer the shot, Jarren exploded.
It was not a conscious act. It was a primal, instinctual eruption from the deepest, most terrified part of his brain. The delirium of the fever, combined with the residual trauma of the previous night and the new, immediate threat, created a perfect storm of pure, animalistic panic.
He let out a roar, a sound so guttural and ferocious it seemed impossible it could come from a human throat. With a single, convulsive movement, he threw himself upright on the cot. The IV stand crashed to the floor. The monitor shrieked as the leads were ripped from his chest.
Triston, Cora, and I, who had been moving in to form our supportive fortress, were completely unprepared for the sheer, explosive violence of it. He threw his arms out, and the force of the movement sent all three of us stumbling backward. It wasn’t the coordinated strength of an athlete; it was the terrifying, adrenaline-fueled power of a cornered animal fighting for its life.
We fell back, forming a stunned, semi-circular wall around the cot. The doctor and nurse, their faces pale with shock, retreated to the doorway.
Jarren stood unsteadily on the cot, his body trembling, his chest heaving. His hospital gown was askew, his bandaged hand held protectively to his chest. But it was his eyes that held the true horror of the scene.
They were wide open, but there was no one home. They were wild, unfocused, blazing with a terrifying light that was not of this world. He wasn’t seeing a trainer’s room, or his teammates, or his doctors. He was seeing the demons. He was seeing the man with the baseballs. He was seeing the fan in Cleveland. He was seeing the face in the mirror that told him to pull the trigger. He was fighting a war on a dozen fronts at once, and we were all the enemy.
He crouched on the cot, a low growl rumbling in his chest, his head swiveling back and forth as he tracked threats that only he could see. He was a gladiator in a spectral arena, surrounded by every ghost that had ever haunted him.
“Get back,” he snarled, the voice not his own. It was deeper, rougher, the voice of pure survival instinct. “Don’t touch me.”
Cora took a tentative step forward, his hands raised in a placating gesture. “Mijo, it’s me. It’s Alex. We’re trying to help you.”
Jarren’s wild eyes locked onto him, but there was no recognition. “Liar!” he spat, recoiling as if from a physical blow. “You’re with them. All of you.”
The room was frozen in a state of terrifying, high-stakes paralysis. The medical procedure had been violently aborted. The patient was now a danger to himself and others. The men who were supposed to be his protectors had been cast as his tormentors.
Dr. Collins, from the relative safety of the doorway, spoke in a low, urgent tone. “He’s in a febrile delirium. He’s completely dissociated. We can’t approach him like this. We need to call security. We may need to sedate him forcibly.”
“No,” I said instantly, my voice a sharp, commanding crack that cut through the tension. I took a step forward, placing myself between the doctors and the cot. “No security. No restraints. You will not treat him like a prisoner.”
I turned to face the wild-eyed man on the cot. I knew that the General Manager couldn’t reach him. The coach couldn’t reach him. But maybe, just maybe, the man who now knew his whole story could find a way through the fire.
The first attempt had failed catastrophically. We had to find another way in. And we had to do it before the infection raging through his body won the war for good.
<the first doctor who was brave enough made the mistake of trying to control Jarren with commands of authority. He stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. His aim was true. The doctor fell on his backside. It almost gave the doctor a haircut.> <Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning> <It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done> <add more details. write as long as you need> <stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
My command to hold back security had created a tense, fragile stalemate. Dr. Collins, though clearly unnerved, was a professional. He understood the optics and the potential trauma of using force. He held up a hand to the nurse, who was already reaching for her phone.
“Okay, Mr. Breslow,” the doctor said, his voice tight but controlled. “We’ll try it your way first. But we are on a clock. That fever is not our friend.”
He took a deep breath, his composure returning. He was a surgeon, used to being in command. He decided to take the lead himself. It was a brave decision. It was the wrong one.
He took a single, deliberate step forward, crossing an invisible threshold into the circle of chaos that surrounded the cot. He raised his hand, not in a placating gesture, but in one of authority.
“Jarren,” he said, his voice the firm, unwavering tone of a doctor used to being obeyed. “You need to lie down. Now. We are going to treat your hand.”
He had made a catastrophic error. He had used a command. He had tried to impose his will. To Jarren’s fever-addled, trauma-soaked mind, it was the voice of his father in the park. It was the voice of every coach who had ever pushed him too far. It was the voice of control.
The reaction was instantaneous and terrifyingly precise.
Before any of us could even register the movement, Jarren’s good hand shot out. He snatched a glass of water from the now-overturned bedside table with uncanny speed. In the same fluid, violent motion, he hurled it.
It wasn’t a wild, panicked throw. It was the throw of a world-class athlete. His aim was lethally true. The glass flew past Dr. Collins’s head, missing his temple by less than an inch. It shattered against the wall behind him with a sound like a gunshot. A fine spray of water and glass rained down.
Dr. Collins, his face ashen, stumbled backward and fell hard onto his backside, a look of pure, unadulterated shock on his face. The glass had been so close it had ruffled his hair.
A dead silence fell over the room, broken only by the sound of Jarren’s harsh, ragged breathing. He remained crouched on the cot, his chest heaving, his wild eyes darting between the fallen doctor and the rest of us, daring anyone else to cross the line.
The nurse let out a small, terrified squeak and flattened herself against the doorframe.
It was over. The attempt at a gentle, persuasive approach was finished.
Any medical staff who now even shifted their weight or looked like they might approach the cot was met with a low, rumbling growl from Jarren, a clear, primal warning that another attack would be instantaneous. He had established his territory, and he would defend it with lethal force.
Dr. Collins, helped to his feet by a shaken Triston Casas, brushed the glass fragments from his coat. The kindness was gone from his eyes, replaced by a grim, clinical necessity.
“That’s it,” he said, his voice trembling with a mixture of fear and anger. “I’m not putting my staff at risk. He’s left us no choice.”
He looked directly at me, his gaze hard and unforgiving.
“We have to sedate him. Forcibly. We’ll need security to restrain him while we administer the injection. It’s the only way we can get near him to treat that hand before he goes into septic shock.”
I felt my heart sink. This was my worst-case scenario. The one thing I had sworn to prevent. We were going to have to treat him like a prisoner, to physically overpower him, to add another layer of trauma to the mountain he was already buried under. It felt like a profound failure.
I looked at the man on the cot, a cornered animal, ready to fight to the death against the very people trying to save his life. I looked at the syringe of sedative the nurse was now preparing with shaking hands. I looked at the phone she was about to use to call for security.
There was no other way. We had failed.
And in that moment of absolute despair, Alex Cora, who had been standing silently by the wall, his face a mask of anguish, took a single, deliberate step forward.
<the first doctor who was brave enough made the mistake of trying to control Jarren with commands of authority. He stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. His aim was true. Had the doctor not dodged on pure instinct, it would have hit him squarely on the nose. The doctor fell on his backside. The glass almost gave the doctor a haircut.> <Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning> <It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done> <add more details. write as long as you need> <stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
Dr. Collins, despite my warning, was a man of action and science, accustomed to being in command of critical situations. He saw a patient in a dangerous state, and his training dictated a direct approach. He took a deep breath, his face set with clinical determination, and took a decisive step forward, crossing the invisible, shimmering line of Jarren’s personal space.
“Jarren, that’s enough,” he said, his voice firm, authoritative, the voice of a doctor used to being obeyed. “You need to lie down. We are going to treat you. Now.”
It was a catastrophic miscalculation.
He wasn’t speaking to Jarren Duran. He was speaking to the cornered animal, to the terrified child, to the soldier in the spectral arena. And that entity responded not to reason, but to threat.
In a blur of motion so fast it defied his feverish state, Jarren’s good hand shot out. It snatched a thick glass water tumbler from the bedside table with uncanny speed and precision. There was no hesitation. No wind-up. His arm whipped forward, and the glass flew through the air like a projectile, a missile of pure, instinctual defiance.
His aim was terrifyingly true.
Dr. Collins, to his credit, reacted on pure, primal instinct. He threw himself backward, a clumsy, desperate flinch. The glass rocketed past where his head had been a split second before, missing his nose by less than an inch. It shattered against the wall behind him with a sound like a gunshot, spraying the area with a shower of glittering shards. The doctor, his balance gone, stumbled and fell hard onto his backside, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated shock. The glass had passed so close to his head that it felt like it had given him a haircut.
The room plunged into a new, more dangerous level of silence. The line had been crossed, and the consequences were now terrifyingly clear.
Jarren remained crouched on the cot, his chest heaving, his wild eyes darting between the fallen doctor and the rest of us. He was a predator who had just driven off the first challenger, and he was ready for the next.
The nurse, who had been inching forward, froze in her tracks. She looked at the shattered glass, then at the feral man on the cot, and wisely retreated back to the doorway. Any medical staff who even shifted their weight, who looked like they might approach the invisible line, was met with a low, rumbling growl from deep in Jarren’s chest, a clear, unambiguous warning.
The standoff was absolute. We were helpless.
Dr. Collins, shaken but unharmed, scrambled back to his feet, his clinical composure shattered. He looked at me, his eyes wide with a new, grim understanding.
“You were right,” he said, his voice trembling slightly. “We can’t reach him. He’s a danger. The delirium is too severe.” He pulled out his phone. “I’m calling for a security team and a psych consult. We have to sedate him. There is no other way to get this done. We’re wasting time, and the infection is winning.”
I saw the terrible, inevitable logic of his words. In any other hospital, in any other situation, he would be right. Restraints. A powerful sedative injected into his thigh. A procedure performed on an unconscious, uncooperative patient. It was the only logical path forward.
But I looked at Jarren, crouched and terrified on that cot, fighting ghosts that only he could see. And I knew, with a certainty that went beyond logic, that if we did that to him, if we treated him like a prisoner and violated his body while he was helpless, we might save his hand, but we would break his spirit forever. The trust we had spent the last twenty-four hours building would be annihilated.
“No,” I said again, my voice low and firm. I stepped in front of the doctor, blocking his path, shielding Jarren with my own body. “Give us one more chance. Give him one more chance.”
I turned to Alex Cora. Our eyes met. We both knew what had to be done. The doctor had failed. The GM had failed. The teammate had failed. There was only one person left who had a chance of getting through.
The father.
<Cora realized it was the white uniform and scent of antiseptic on the medical staff that scared Jarren. That’s why the line for doctors was further than the line for him and Craig> <He saw the helplessness beneath the rage. A kid who defied the authority twice and was afraid of the punishment.><Jarren was trapped and couldn’t find the way out. Surrender might bring punishment, but resist might make matters worse><add more details. write as long as you need><stop the scene before Cora made the move>
Cora’s eyes, sharp and observant even in the chaos, darted from the terrified medical staff in the doorway to Jarren on the cot. He saw what I had missed. He saw the pattern. Jarren’s feral gaze was locked on the white coats, on the glint of metal instruments, on the source of the acrid, chemical smell that had triggered his descent. The doctor had crossed a line, yes, but that line was different for him than it was for us. We were familiar. We were part of the clubhouse. They were the outsiders. They were the embodiment of the clinical pain he had just endured and was terrified of facing again.
But Cora saw something deeper. He looked past the snarling, cornered animal and saw the source of its rage. It wasn’t aggression. It was terror. He saw the frantic, helpless panic of a child who has lashed out in fear and is now bracing for the inevitable, crushing retribution.
He saw a kid who had just thrown a rock at the biggest, scariest man in the park and was now trapped, with nowhere to run.
Jarren’s entire posture was a paradox of defiance and dread. He was crouched, ready to fight, but his body was trembling with a fear that went beyond the immediate threat. He was trapped in a terrible, familiar loop. He had defied authority once by refusing the scalpel, and the result had been an overwhelming force he couldn’t fight. Now, he had defied it again, this time with violence. And in the twisted logic of his trauma, a greater transgression could only lead to a greater punishment.
He was trapped. To surrender now felt like admitting guilt, inviting the wrath he was certain was coming. But to continue to resist felt like it would only make the eventual punishment worse. He was a child caught in a lie, a soldier caught behind enemy lines, with no good options, no clear path to safety. He was utterly, terrifyingly alone in his own head, surrounded by enemies, with the ghosts of his past whispering that he deserved whatever was about to happen.
Cora’s expression softened. The grim determination faded, replaced by an immense, aching wave of paternal empathy. He wasn’t looking at a delirious athlete anymore. He was looking at a lost boy who had just made a terrible mistake and was scared to death of what came next.
He turned to me and Triston, his voice a low, urgent whisper. “He’s not fighting us. He’s fighting them,” he said, nodding toward the medical staff. “And he’s scared. He thinks he’s going to be punished for what he just did.”
He then looked at Dr. Collins. “Doctor,” he said, his voice respectful but firm. “You and your nurse need to leave the room. Now. Leave the sedative on the table. But you have to go. Your presence is making it worse.”
Dr. Collins started to protest. “But the procedure…”
“The procedure will not happen until he is calm,” Cora cut him off, his authority absolute. “And he will not be calm while you are in here. Please. Give us the room.”
The doctor, seeing the unshakeable conviction in Cora’s eyes and still shaken from his own near-miss, finally relented. He gave a curt nod, instructed the nurse to place a prepared syringe of sedative on a clean tray near the door, and then they both retreated, closing the door behind them.
The immediate threat was gone. The room was now just us. The three men who had held him through the fire, and the lost soul crouched on the cot.
The growling in Jarren’s chest subsided slightly, but his eyes were still wild, still darting around, looking for the next attack. He was still trapped in the nightmare.
Cora knew he had one chance, one opportunity to reach him. He couldn’t use authority. He couldn’t use logic. He had to use the one language that might still get through.
The language of a father.
<Cora stepped up with open hands, showing he had nothing to hurt Jarren> <Jarren seemed to regard Cora as less of a threat. Reluctantly let Cora came near.> <Cora coaxed Jarren into going back to the bed, holding him like his own son> <Craig and Casas held Jarren down> <the medical staff tried to do this without sedative> <add more details. Write as long as you need.> <stop the scene before their second attempt>
Alex Cora took a slow, deliberate breath, centering himself. He became an island of calm in the turbulent room. He held his hands up and open, palms forward, a universal gesture of peace. It was a conscious, symbolic act. I have no weapons. I have nothing to hurt you with.
He took his first step, moving with a slowness that was almost painful to watch. He didn’t speak. He just moved, his eyes locked on Jarren’s, his expression one of infinite, unconditional patience.
Jarren, still crouched on the cot, watched him, a low growl still vibrating in his chest. But the ferocious edge was gone. He saw the open hands. He saw the familiar face of the man who had held him, who had murmured to him in Spanish. This figure was different from the white-coated threats. The line of his personal space, the boundary of his fear, was closer for this man. He didn’t relax, but he didn’t lash out. He watched, and he waited.
Cora took another step. And another. He was inside the circle of danger now, well past the point where the doctor had been attacked. He stopped about an arm’s length from the cot.
“Hey, mijo,” he said, his voice a soft, low murmur, the same voice he had used during the first ordeal. “It’s just me. Just Alex. No one else is going to come in. It’s just us now.”
Jarren’s wild eyes flickered from Cora’s face to me and Triston, then back. He was assessing the situation, his fevered brain trying to process the change.
“I know you’re scared,” Cora continued, his voice gentle, hypnotic. “You did a scary thing. But you’re not in trouble. No one is angry with you. You were just protecting yourself. I get it.”
He was validating the fear, not dismissing it. He was telling the terrified child that his reaction was understandable.
“But you’re not safe right now, JD. The sickness is trying to win. We can’t let it. We have to be stronger than the sickness. You and me. And Craig. And Triston. The four of us. We have to fight it together.”
He held out one of his open hands. “I need you to lie down now. I need you to let us help you. I’m not going to leave you. I will stay right here. I promise. No one will hurt you. I promise.”
He was speaking in promises, in oaths. He was rebuilding the foundation of trust, one word at a time.
Jarren stared at the outstretched hand. He looked at Cora’s face, searching for any sign of deception, any hint of the trap he was sure was coming. He saw none. He saw only a deep, aching sincerity.
Slowly, hesitantly, the tension began to drain from his body. The feral crouch softened. He was still wary, still terrified, but the immediate, violent resistance was fading. With a low moan that was part exhaustion, part surrender, he allowed his body to uncoil. He sank back onto the cot, his movements clumsy and weak.
The moment he was down, Cora moved in. He sat on the edge of the bed and gathered him into his arms again, pulling him close, shielding his eyes from the rest of the room. “That’s it, mijo,” he whispered. “Good boy. You’re so strong. So strong. We got you.”
This was our cue. Triston and I moved in, our movements swift but calm. We took our positions, flanking the cot. Triston took hold of Jarren’s good arm, his grip firm but not punishing. I placed my hands on his legs, a steadying weight. We were the anchors, holding him to the present, preventing him from drifting back into the nightmare.
Cora looked over his shoulder at me and gave a single, sharp nod. I walked to the door and opened it just enough to speak to the doctor.
“He’s calm,” I said, my voice a low, urgent whisper. “He’s with us. But the window is small. Let’s try it now. No anesthetic injection. Just the silver nitrate. Let’s get it over with.”
I could see the hesitation on the doctor’s face, the professional doubt. This was unorthodox, dangerous. But he also saw the absolute certainty in my eyes. He nodded grimly.
The doctor and nurse re-entered the room, their movements now quiet, almost stealthy. They stayed on the periphery, avoiding Jarren’s direct line of sight. The nurse handed a new tray to Nick Paparesta, who had been a silent, waiting presence this whole time. On the tray was a small brown bottle and a set of long, cotton-tipped applicators. Silver nitrate.
Nick approached the bed, his own face a mask of grim necessity. He looked at the three of us, then at the man cradled in Cora’s arms. We were ready. The human fortress was rebuilt, stronger and more determined than ever. We were about to walk him back into the fire, and this time, there would be no retreat.

Write as long as you need.> <stop the scene before the debridement starts>
With the white coats gone, a fragile quiet descended upon the room. Cora took a slow, deliberate breath, centering himself. He knew this was it.
He began to move forward, his steps measured, almost gliding. He didn’t walk like a manager or a coach. He walked like a man approaching a frightened deer. His hands were open at his sides, palms facing forward, a universal sign of peace. He was showing Jarren he was unarmed, that he held no weapons, no instruments of pain.
“Easy now, mijo,” Cora said, his voice a low, gentle murmur, almost a hum. He didn’t raise it. He forced Jarren to quiet the storm in his own mind to hear him. “It’s just me. It’s just Alex. No one else is here. Just us.”
Jarren’s wild eyes locked onto him. The low growl in his chest was still there, but it lost some of its edge. He watched Cora’s slow advance, his body still coiled like a spring, but the explosive energy had lessened. He saw the open hands. He heard the soft voice. This figure was not like the others. This one was familiar. This one was less of a threat.
Cora continued his slow, deliberate advance until he reached the edge of the cot, just outside the invisible line Jarren had defended so violently. He stopped there. He didn’t reach out. He didn’t command. He just stood, a calm, patient presence.
“They’re gone, JD,” Cora said softly. “No one is going to hurt you. I’m not going to let them. You’re not in trouble. You hear me? You did nothing wrong. You were scared. That’s all. You’re not in trouble.”
He repeated the last phrase, letting it sink in. “No estás en problemas.” You are not in trouble. It was a direct counter-agent to the poison of fear and guilt flooding Jarren’s system.
Jarren’s breathing hitched. A flicker of lucidity, of confusion, crossed his face. He was still trapped in the nightmare, but a sliver of the real world was beginning to break through.
“I know you’re tired,” Cora continued, his voice a hypnotic, steady rhythm. “I know you’re hurting. You’ve been fighting for so long. You don’t have to fight anymore. The fight is over. It’s time to rest now. Let us help you rest.”
He slowly, telegraphing the movement, knelt down, bringing himself lower than Jarren, a gesture of complete submission. “I need you to lie down, mijo. Can you do that for me? Can you lie down and let us take care of you? I promise you, I will not leave your side. I will not let anyone hurt you.”
Jarren stared at the kneeling man, his manager, his father figure, who was making himself small and vulnerable for him. The wildness in his eyes began to recede, replaced by a vast, bottomless exhaustion. The fight was too much. The burden was too heavy. He couldn’t carry it anymore.
With a low, shuddering moan, he relented. He slowly, stiffly, uncoiled his body and lay back down on the cot, his eyes never leaving Cora’s face. It was an act of supreme, desperate trust.
The moment he was down, the three of us moved in, our actions now a practiced, solemn ritual.
Cora leaned over him, one hand on his chest, the other stroking his hair, his voice a constant stream of reassurance. “That’s it, son. Good boy. Just rest. We’ve got you.”
Triston and I took our positions on either side. We each took one of Jarren’s arms. Our grip was gentle but firm, an anchor against the pain we knew was coming.
I looked toward the door and gave a single, sharp nod.
Dr. Collins and the nurse re-entered the room, their movements now quiet, deferential. They saw the scene before them not as a medical procedure, but as a sacred trust. The doctor looked at me, his eyes asking the silent question about the sedative.
I looked down at Jarren, who was lying still, his eyes closed, trusting us. To inject him now, to use force when he had just given us his trust, felt like a betrayal.
I shook my head almost imperceptibly. No sedative. Not unless we absolutely have to.
The doctor gave a grim, understanding nod. He knew the risk, but he also understood the situation. He and the nurse approached the cot like acolytes approaching an altar, their movements slow and respectful. They were no longer the authority. They were instruments, acting under the protection and guidance of the men holding the patient down.
The fortress was rebuilt. The patient had surrendered. The second, more terrible ordeal was about to begin.
<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen> <several pieces of debris hid deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <Getting those debris out almost unleashed the wild animal again.><They managed to calm Jarren down> <add more details. Write as long as you need.> <stop before the antiseptic>
The second debridement was a descent into a deeper circle of hell. The wound, which had been a raw, clean canvas of pain the night before, was now an angry, inflamed, and swollen landscape. The tissues were puffy and hypersensitive, the nerve endings screaming in protest at the slightest touch. The fever had turned his hand into a furnace, radiating a heat that we could feel even through our own tensed hands.
Dr. Collins worked with a grim, silent intensity, his earlier clinical detachment replaced by a profound, focused respect for the man on the table. He knew he was causing immense suffering, and he wasted no movement, no second.
The local anesthetic they had managed to apply did almost nothing. It was like trying to quell a forest fire with a garden hose. The inflammation was too severe, the pain signals too overwhelming.
The first touch of the forceps was a lightning strike. Jarren’s body arched off the cot, a silent scream tearing through his clenched teeth. His eyes, which had been closed in exhausted surrender, flew open, the wildness flaring back to life.
“Hold him,” the doctor grunted, his own focus absolute as he zeroed in on a dark speck buried deep in the swollen tissue.
Triston and I tightened our grip, our own muscles straining against the violent, involuntary spasms that wracked Jarren’s body. Cora pressed down firmly on his shoulders, his voice a constant, desperate litany. “It’s okay, mijo, it’s okay, we’re right here, stay with us, stay with us, JD, stay with me!”
But Jarren was slipping away again, back to that dark, haunted park. He started to thrash, the growl returning to his chest. He was losing the battle against the demons.
“Talk to him, Triston!” I said, my voice a sharp command. “Keep him here!”
Casas, his face a mask of empathetic agony, leaned in close, his mouth right next to Jarren’s ear. “JD! Hey! It’s me, it’s Casas! Listen to my voice, man! Think about the game! Think about hitting a ball 500 feet! Remember that bomb you hit off Cole last year? The one that shut the whole stadium up? That’s you, man! That’s who you are! You’re a monster! You’re stronger than this! Stay with me!”
He was throwing out lifelines, anything to anchor Jarren’s consciousness to the present, to his identity as a ballplayer, not a victim.
It was working, but just barely. Jarren’s thrashing lessened, his focus shifting from the internal ghosts to the external voice of his teammate. He was still in agony, but he was fighting to stay present.
The procedure was a brutal excavation. The doctor found several more particles of turf and dirt, hidden deep beneath the muscle fibers, shielded by the swelling. Each one had to be painstakingly, agonizingly, extracted. Getting them out almost unleashed the wild animal again. At one point, as the doctor probed for a particularly deep fragment, Jarren let out a raw, guttural roar and bucked so hard he nearly threw Triston off his feet.
“I’m losing him!” Triston yelled, his own voice strained with the effort.
Cora immediately changed his tactic. He stopped the soothing murmurs and became the manager. “Duran!” he barked, his voice a sharp, authoritative crack that cut through the pain-filled haze. “Look at me! Control your breathing! In through the nose, out through the mouth! Like we do in the cage! You are a professional athlete! You control this! Do not let it control you! Breathe with me! Now!”
The sudden shift, the familiar command of his manager, seemed to shock Jarren’s system. His wild eyes found Cora’s. He saw the fierce, unyielding glare of the man who had pushed him through a thousand drills. Instinct took over. His breathing, which had been a series of panicked gasps, began to hitch and then regulate, following the pattern Cora was dictating.
He was still in hell. But he was breathing through the fire.
We fell into a grim, desperate rhythm. The doctor would work, causing a fresh spike of agony. Jarren would start to lose control. Triston would talk about baseball, about hitting, about strength. Cora would bark commands, forcing him to focus on his breathing, on control. I remained the silent, steady anchor, my hands a constant, unmoving pressure, a physical manifestation of the organization’s unwavering support.
It was a symphony of suffering and support, a brutal ballet of pain and perseverance.
Finally, after an eternity that lasted fifteen minutes, Dr. Collins dropped the last bloodied instrument onto the tray.
“That’s it,” he said, his voice hoarse. “I’m sure of it this time. There’s nothing left in there.”
The three of us sagged with a collective, bone-deep relief. Jarren lay limp on the cot, his body drenched in sweat, his chest rising and falling with the deep, controlled breaths Cora had drilled into him. He was present. He was conscious. He was exhausted beyond all measure.
He had made it through the second debridement. He had faced the fire again, and with our help, he had not been consumed.
But we all knew what was coming next. The nurse was already reaching for the bottle of silver nitrate.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <Cora coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts>
The moment the nurse unscrewed the cap from the bottle of silver nitrate solution, the smell hit the air. It was a scent far sharper and more malevolent than the previous antiseptic. It was a sterile, metallic, and deeply threatening odor that cut through the room like a blade.
It sliced right through the exhausted, pain-dazed fog of Jarren’s mind.
His eyes, which had been half-closed in a state of controlled endurance, flew wide open. The fragile peace we had just fought so hard to win shattered into a million pieces. He saw the nurse preparing a long, thick cotton-tipped applicator. He saw the dark, ominous liquid. He knew.
“No,” he breathed, the word a faint, horrified puff of air.
Then, the panic hit him with the force of a physical blow. He began to struggle again, but this was different from the feral, delirious rage of before. This was the clear-eyed, absolute terror of a man who knew exactly what was coming. He had a frame of reference now. He knew the fire, and he knew this one would be worse.
“No! No, Alex, please!” he cried, his head whipping around to look at his manager. His voice was no longer a child’s plea; it was the desperate, rational bargaining of a man on death row. “You can’t. You can’t let him. It’ll… I can’t do it again. I can’t.”
He turned his pleading eyes to Triston. “Casas, man, tell them! Tell them to stop! You saw what it was like! Please!”
Finally, his gaze landed on me. It was a look of raw, desperate appeal, a final, hopeless prayer. “Craig, please. I’m begging you. There has to be another way. Anything but that. I’ll take the infection. I’ll risk it. I don’t care. Just please… don’t let him do that to me again.”
He was offering to trade his career for a reprieve from this one, single, unimaginable moment of agony.
My own resolve wavered. To hear him beg, to see the clear, lucid terror in his eyes, was a thousand times worse than his delirious thrashing. My entire being screamed at me to call it off, to find another way.
But I looked at Dr. Collins, who simply shook his head, his expression a mask of grim, medical necessity. There was no other way.
Cora, his own face a portrait of paternal agony, leaned in so his forehead was almost touching Jarren’s.
“Mijo, listen to me,” he said, his voice a low, intense whisper that demanded to be heard. “Look at me. I know. I know what I’m asking. If there was any other way on God’s green earth, we would take it. But there is not. This is the poison that will kill the poison. This is the fire that will save you.”
He pulled back slightly, forcing Jarren to see the unwavering conviction in his eyes. “I am not going to lie to you. This is going to be the worst pain you have ever felt in your life. It is going to be long. It is going to feel like it will never end. But it will end. And we will be here for every single second of it. We are not leaving. We are not letting go.”
He gestured to me and Triston. “Look. We are your brothers. We are your family right now. And we are going to hold you through this. You will not go through it alone.”
He took a deep breath. “I am asking you for the last bit of trust you have. I am asking you to be the strongest you have ever been, for just a little while longer. Can you do that for me? Can you do that for us?”
Jarren stared into his manager’s eyes, his own swimming with tears of terror and resignation. He saw no escape. He saw no mercy. He saw only a terrible, necessary path forward, and three men who were promising to walk it with him.
He closed his eyes. The fight was over. The pleading was over. All that was left was a terrible, hollow acceptance.
A single, choked sob escaped his lips. He gave the smallest, most defeated nod I have ever seen.
The three of us moved back into our positions. The human fortress was rebuilt, but the mood was different. It was not a mood of grim determination. It was a mood of profound, shared dread. We were not just bracing for a medical procedure. We were preparing to walk, hand-in-hand, into the heart of the inferno. We knew it was going to be a long, long process.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <With all his managerial skills, Cora coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <add more details. Write as long as you need> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts>
The moment the nurse unscrewed the cap from the bottle of silver nitrate solution, the smell hit the air. It was a scent far sharper and more malevolent than the previous antiseptic. It was a sterile, metallic, and deeply unnatural odor, the smell of chemical cauterization. It cut through the thick, feverish fog in Jarren’s mind like a shard of glass.
His eyes, which had been half-closed in a state of controlled, exhausted agony, flew wide open. The fragile peace we had just fought so hard to win shattered into a million pieces.
“No,” he gasped, the word a choked, desperate plea. He looked at the dark, viscous liquid being poured onto a fresh set of gauze pads, and a new, more profound terror seized him. This was not the fire he knew. This was something else. Something worse.
He started to struggle again, but his movements were weak, pathetic. The second debridement had taken everything from him. He had no strength left to fight, only to beg.
He turned his head, his wild, terrified eyes finding Cora’s. “Alex, no,” he pleaded, his voice breaking. “Please. I can’t. I can’t do it again. It’ll kill me. Please, Alex. Don’t let him.”
He then looked at Triston, his teammate, his brother. “Casas, man, you gotta help me. Tell them no. Please.”
Finally, his gaze landed on me. It was the look of a man making his final appeal before the gallows. “Craig… please. I’ll do anything. I’ll sit out the rest of the season. I don’t care. Just… not that. Please.”
My own resolve wavered. To hear this man, this warrior, so completely broken, begging for mercy, was a torment of its own. My instinct was to scream, “Stop! That’s enough!” But I looked at the angry, inflamed wound, at the fever chart, and I knew that mercy in this moment would be a death sentence later.
It was Alex Cora who stepped into the breach. He had reached the end of his own emotional tether, but he dug deep and found something more. He summoned every ounce of his managerial skill, every bit of the paternal love he felt for the young man before him.
He leaned in so close their foreheads were almost touching, forcing Jarren to look at him and nothing else. He didn’t raise his voice. He lowered it, making it a conspiratorial, urgent whisper.
“Listen to me, JD,” he began, his voice intense, compelling. “Forget them. Forget the doctors, forget Craig, forget everyone. It’s just you and me right now. Like we’re in the cage. Just you and me.”
He waited until Jarren’s frantic eyes focused on his.
“You’re right,” Cora said, and the admission shocked Jarren into silence. “This is going to be hell. It’s going to be the worst thing you’ve ever felt. I’m not going to lie to you. There is no preparing for it.”
He paused, letting the brutal honesty sink in.
“But this is the last battle,” he continued, his voice dropping even lower. “This is it. This is the pitch that wins the World Series. It’s the bottom of the ninth, two outs, bases loaded, and you’re on the mound. This fire… this is the last thing standing between you and victory. Between you and healing. Between you and getting your life back.”
He tapped Jarren’s chest with his finger. “The kid who got pegged with baseballs couldn’t do this. The player who was afraid of the fans couldn’t do this. Only the man you are right now, the man who survived all of that, is strong enough to face this. This is your moment to prove to every single one of those ghosts that they don’t own you anymore.”
He was not just coaxing. He was challenging. He was reframing the narrative from one of torture to one of ultimate triumph. He was giving Jarren’s pain a purpose.
“It’s going to be a long process,” Cora said, his eyes never leaving Jarren’s. “It’s going to feel like it will never end. But Triston will be here. Craig will be here. And I will be right here. We are going to be your armor. We will hold you through the fire. And when it’s over, you will be clean. You will be whole. And you will have won.”
He leaned back slightly. “This is the last fight, mijo. Are you ready to win it?”
Jarren stared at him, his chest heaving with ragged breaths. The terror was still in his eyes, but something else was there now too. A flicker of the old fire. A spark of the competitor who could not, would not, fail.
He closed his eyes, a single tear of pure, agonizing resolve rolling down his temple. He gave the smallest, most infinitesimal nod he could manage.
It was enough.
Cora looked at us, his own face a mask of grim determination. He nodded to Triston and me. We moved back into our positions, our grips firm, our bodies braced. The human fortress was re-formed, more solemn, more unified than ever before.
We were ready. We were going to walk through the gates of hell with him, one last time.
<a split second before the antiseptic was applied, Cora, Craig and Casas realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony> <Jarren was pleading for sanity, but everyone mistook it for mere fear of pain> <Accepting Cora's challenge meant accepting the punishment from his father. > <By coaxing Jarren into accepting the antiseptic, Cora coaxed him back to the park> <The cycle repeats: Jarren got hurt. Jarren play through it. Jarren broke. Jarren went back for more.> <But there’s no way back. They had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment> <add more details. write as long as you need> <stop the scene before the antiseptic begins>

As Nick Paparesta picked up the first gauze pad soaked in the dark, viscous silver nitrate, a sudden, horrifying realization dawned on me. It was a moment of terrible, gut-wrenching clarity, a flash of insight so profound it felt like a physical blow.
I looked at Cora, and I saw in his wide, stricken eyes that he had seen it too. I glanced at Triston, and the dawning horror on his face confirmed it. We had all, in the exact same split second, understood our catastrophic mistake.
Jarren’s pleading, his terror, his desperate bargaining—we had seen it as a fear of pain. A primal, understandable, but ultimately straightforward fear of physical agony. We had been wrong. So profoundly, devastatingly wrong.
He wasn’t just afraid of the fire. He was afraid of why he was being burned.
His mind, shattered by fever and trauma, could not process this level of suffering as a medical necessity. It could only comprehend it through the single, terrible framework it had for overwhelming, inescapable pain inflicted by an authority figure: the park. He wasn’t just pleading for the pain to stop. He was pleading for his sanity. He was begging us not to send him back to the place where love and pain were the same thing, where punishment was the only language of care.
And we, in our desperate attempt to help him, had done exactly that.
Cora’s challenge, which I had seen as a masterful piece of motivation, was, in this new, horrifying light, an act of unintentional cruelty. By framing it as the “last battle,” as the “final test of strength,” he had perfectly mirrored the twisted logic of Jarren’s father. He had reinforced the core trauma of his life: that to be strong, to be worthy, he had to endure an unbearable punishment.
Accepting Cora’s challenge didn’t mean accepting healing. It meant accepting his father’s terms. It meant willingly walking back into the park, picking up the bat, and bracing for the baseballs, because that was the only way to prove he was good enough.
My blood ran cold. The cycle. We hadn’t broken it. We had become the next link in the chain. Jarren gets hurt. Jarren plays through it. Jarren breaks. And we, the new authority figures, the new fathers, coax him back for more, telling him it will make him stronger.
My entire being screamed to call it off. To tell the doctor to stop. But it was too late. The realization had come a second too late.
There was no way back.
The medical necessity was absolute. The infection was raging. To stop now would be to condemn him to a far worse fate. We had coaxed him to the edge of the abyss, and now, for his own survival, we had to push him in.
The knowledge of what we were about to do, of the psychological damage we were about to inflict in the name of physical healing, was a sickness in my soul.
I looked at Cora. His face was ashen, his eyes filled with a self-recrimination so profound it was terrifying to behold. He knew what he had just done. He had used his bond with his player, his love for his surrogate son, to lead him back into the heart of his own personal hell.
Triston looked like he was going to vomit. The simple, noble act of supporting his teammate had been twisted into something monstrous.
We were no longer a fortress of support. We were his captors. We were the instruments of his trauma.
We had to hold him still. We had to pin him down and allow this to happen, knowing that every scream, every plea, was not just a reaction to the chemical fire on his hand, but to the psychological inferno we had just reignited in his mind.
We took our positions, our movements now stiff, robotic, devoid of the grace and empathy of before. Our hands on his body were no longer anchors of support; they were the shackles of his past, locking him into place for the punishment he believed he deserved.
Jarren, with his eyes squeezed shut, took a final, shuddering breath. He was ready. He had accepted the terms. He was ready to go back to the park.
And we, his protectors, his brothers, his fathers, were the ones sending him there.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left> <He was hurled back to the park> <He thought this was the punishment for his failures> <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun: lost the ball in twilight. didn't chase after it because he was drained by helplessness and loneliness. Afraid to turn his head to look at the fans> <dropped two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that><dropped an easy liner, cost the game, Bello was furious, Bello roamed down the tunnel and left a trail of roars in his wake: "Big dumb fuck! Incredible! You must be fucking kidding me!"> <dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again> <struck out with the bases loaded, wasted Red Sox’s last rally in eighth inning> <caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> <add more details. Write as long as you need.> <the antiseptic process: 1/5>
The moment the silver nitrate touched his flesh, the world ended.
There was no scream this time. No roar. The sound was a high, thin, keening wail that seemed to be pulled from the very fabric of his being. It was the sound of a soul being unmade. He had no fight left. The second trip to hell in less than twenty-four hours was too much. His body, held firm by our guilty, trembling hands, went rigid, a board of pure, incandescent agony.
He was hurled back in time, not as a memory, but as a vivid, all-consuming reality. He was in the park. The searing fire on his hand was the sting of a dozen baseballs hitting him at once. The clinical smell of the room was the scent of his own fear. And he knew, with the terrible, unshakeable certainty of a child who has learned the rules of his world, that this was his punishment.
This was the penance for every failure, every sin, every time he had not been good enough.
He was five years old, and the bat felt too heavy. He wasn’t swinging his best. This was the price.
He was fourteen, standing in front of a mirror, his heart aching with the desperate, unanswered question. Why aren’t you growing? This was the punishment for a body that had betrayed him.
He was in center field at Fenway, the twilight sky a confusing, purple haze. Raimel Tapia’s fly ball went up, and he lost it. He just… lost it. The helplessness was a lead weight in his stomach. He heard the roar of the crowd, the sound of Tapia circling the bases for an inside-the-park home run. He didn’t chase it. He couldn’t. He was paralyzed by the sheer, crushing loneliness of his failure, terrified to turn and face the 37,000 pairs of eyes that he knew were burning holes in his back. This agony, this fire on his hand, was the delayed echo of that roar.
He was in Kansas City, the sun a brutal, unforgiving glare. He dropped one fly ball. Then another. The fans were on him, their voices a torrent of abuse. He yelled back, his own frustration and self-loathing spilling out in a wave of misdirected anger. This was the cost of that loss of control.
He saw Brayan Bello on the mound, his face a mask of disbelief and fury after an easy liner ticked off his glove and fell, costing them the game. He remembered the sound of Bello storming down the dugout tunnel, the roars echoing long after he was gone: "Big dumb fuck! Incredible! You must be fucking kidding me!" Bello hadn’t been yelling at him, not really, but in Jarren’s mind, every word was a brand on his soul. This was the payment for that error.
He saw himself diving for a ball, missing it, then trying to smother it with his body like a grenade, only to have it squirt away as the winning run scored. He saw himself at the plate in the eighth inning, bases loaded, the team’s last hope, swinging through a slider for strike three. He saw himself breaking for second, only to have Jonah Heim’s perfect throw beat him by a mile, killing a rally with Raffy at the plate.
Each memory was a fresh wave of fire, a new layer of deserved punishment. He wasn’t just enduring a medical procedure. He was being systematically tortured for every mistake he had ever made, every time he had failed to be the hero, every time he had been the small kid who wasn’t good enough.
He was limp in our arms, his body a conduit for unimaginable pain, his mind a slideshow of his own personal hell. And we, his protectors, were the ones holding him down, ensuring he could not escape his sentence. The antiseptic, the first of five agonizing applications, continued to burn.
<Jarren began to apologize for those failures, his voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional athletic being interviewed>
<sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid> 
<Not swinging the best> 
<Not growing up. 5’4, 100 pounds going into high school>
<the Tapia inside the park homerun. Lack of hustle.> 
<Kansas City. Lost the game. >
<The dropped liner. Bello got an L instead of W. not even a quality start>
<The failed attempt of dive and smother (even though everyone else in the room thought it wasn't a good idea to smother a liner off Corey Seager's bat, exit velo 100. Everyone else was relieved that the ball bounced past him.)> 
<The struckout which wasted the last rally> 
<caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> 
<add more details, write as long as you need> 
<the antiseptic process: 2/5>
The second application of silver nitrate was a descent into madness. The initial shock had passed, replaced by a steady, relentless, all-consuming agony. Jarren’s mind, unable to escape the physical torment, fractured completely. He began to speak, his voice a slurred, broken monotone, drifting between the man he was and the boy he had been.
He was a professional athlete in a post-game press conference, taking responsibility, his words a hollow echo of a thousand clubhouse interviews.
“...my responsibility to make that play...” he mumbled, his head rolling against Cora’s chest. “The twilight was a factor, but a major league outfielder has to account for the conditions. There’s no excuse for the lack of hustle on the recovery. I let my teammates down. I let the city down.”
Then, in the space of a breath, the man was gone, and the child was there, his grammar dissolving, his voice becoming thin and reedy.
“...I not swingin’ good, Daddy...” he whispered, the words catching on a sob. “...bat’s too heavy... I tryin’...”
He was a teenager again, standing before an invisible measuring tape, his voice filled with a shame he couldn’t comprehend.
“...five-foot-four... only a hundred pounds... I don’t know why... I eat... I just don’t grow...”
He was back in Kansas City, the sun in his eyes, the weight of the loss settling on his shoulders.
“...lost the game for us... two plays... can’t happen... it’s on me...”
He was at Fenway, the sound of Bello’s rage echoing in his ears.
“...Bello... he shoulda got the W... a quality start... and I... I boot it... he got the L because of me... not even a quality start... my fault... all my fault...”
He was on the turf, the ball skipping past him, Corey Seager rounding the bases. The memory was sharp, vivid. The rest of us in the room remembered that play with a shudder of relief. Seager had scorched it at over 100 miles per hour. For Jarren to even get a glove on it was a miracle. His attempt to smother it with his body was an act of suicidal bravery that we were all thankful had failed. But in his mind, it was just another failure.
“...shoulda smothered it...” he gasped, his body tensing as he relived the impact that never was. “...gotta stop the run... gotta keep it in front... I failed...”
He was at the plate, the weight of the game on his shoulders.
“...bases loaded... rally... my chance to be the guy... and I chased... chased a slider in the dirt... I knew better... I just... I failed...”
He was on the basepaths, the sight of Raffy at the plate, the feeling of his foot hitting the bag a split second too late.
“...Raffy up... can’t make the last out... can’t get thrown out there... and I did... I did...”
With each confessed failure, a fresh wave of tremors wracked his body. He was offering up his sins, one by one, as payment for the agony he was enduring. He was trying to justify the pain, to make sense of it, to prove that he deserved it.
Cora, his own face a mask of anguish, just held him, murmuring, “No, mijo, no, it’s not your fault, it’s okay, you’re okay.” But the words were a foreign language, unable to penetrate the thick walls of Jarren’s self-flagellating delirium.
Triston and I exchanged a look of pure, helpless horror. We were not just witnessing a medical procedure. We were witnessing a man’s soul being flayed, layer by layer, by the ghosts of his own perceived failures. And we were the ones holding the instruments. The second application burned on, a relentless, purifying fire that felt anything but pure.
<He apologized, he pleaded, he promised, everything he said was about baseball> <His voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic talking to his coaches, manager and GM> <sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid> <He promised to swing the best> <to be bigger, stronger> <to act like All-Star MVP every night. A promise even Ohtani won’t make> <to play 162 games. Even tonight. Tape it up. I can play defense, I can hit, I can run. > <to hustle more(other people’s reactions: how is that possible?)> <to work harder. (other people’s reactions: given his work ethics, maybe he needs to stop sleeping and eating)> <add more details, write as long as you need> <the antiseptic process: 3/5>
The third wave of antiseptic was a journey into the heart of his obsession. The pain had become a constant, a roaring white noise in the background of his fractured consciousness. His mind, seeking an escape, latched onto the only thing that had ever given him structure, purpose, and a path forward: the game. His delirious ramblings became a torrent of apologies, pleas, and impossible promises, all centered around his performance on the diamond.
He was a professional, sitting in an end-of-season meeting with his superiors, his voice a slurred but earnest imitation of clubhouse decorum.
“...I understand the expectations, Craig, Alex...” he mumbled, his head rolling against Cora’s shoulder. “...the second half of last season, the numbers weren’t there. Inconsistent. I take full ownership of that. It won’t happen again. I’ll be better...”
Then, the man would vanish, and the boy, desperate to please, would take his place.
“...I promise I swing my best... every time... no more bad swings, Daddy... I promise...”
He was making deals with his ghosts, bargaining for relief. He promised to fix every flaw, real or imagined.
“...I’ll get bigger... I’ll get stronger...” he gasped, his body tensing as if trying to physically will himself to grow. “...more time in the weight room... I’ll do it... I’ll be big enough...”
He started making promises so grand, so impossible, they were heartbreaking in their sincerity.
“...All-Star MVP... that’s the standard now...” he whispered, his voice filled with a terrible, earnest conviction. “...I’ll play like that every night... I promise... every single night...”
Triston shook his head slowly, his face a mask of sorrowful disbelief. Even Ohtani couldn’t make that promise. But Jarren, in his delirium, believed it was the baseline, the only acceptable level of performance.
His promises became more frantic, more immediate.
“...162 games...” he pleaded, his voice cracking. “...I can do it... I know I can... even tonight... just tape it up... Nick can tape it up... I can play defense... I can hit... I can run... put me in, coach... please, put me in...”
He promised to amplify his greatest strength, to push his most defining characteristic to an impossible, suicidal degree.
“...I’ll hustle more...” he sobbed. “...that ball Tapia hit... I’ll get to it next time... I’ll run faster... I’ll never stop running...”
I looked at Cora, and I could see the same thought reflected in his anguished eyes: How is that even possible? The man already played at a speed that terrified us. To hustle more would be to tear himself apart.
“...I’ll work harder...” he promised, his voice fading to a near-whisper. “...first one in, last one out... every day... I’ll work harder...”
The absurdity of it was crushing. We all knew his work ethic was legendary, almost pathological. For him to work any harder, he would have to give up sleeping and eating entirely. He was promising to sacrifice his very humanity on the altar of the game.
He wasn’t just apologizing for his failures anymore. He was apologizing for his limitations. For being human. He was promising to become a machine, a perfect, tireless, flawless baseball robot, if only the pain would stop.
He was offering up his entire being, everything he was and everything he hoped to be, as a sacrifice. And we stood there, holding him down, as the third application of the chemical fire burned away, accepting his terrible, beautiful, impossible offering.
<the promises became more frentic, as the fire burnt harder> <His voice slurred> <Sometimes he spoke as a grown-up man, a professional atheletic talking to his coaches, manager and GM> <sometimes he retreated to the grammar of his childhood, talking like a kid> <I’ll hit a leadoff homer. > <I’ll pull on a straight steal of home> <He make promises on hitting.>(Casas's reaction: Even Ted Williams can't do that) <He make promises on defense>(Craig's reaction:Even JBJ in his prime won't make such promise) <He make promises on base stealing>(Cora's reaction: Even Jackie Robinson will refuse to do so) <He swear he would do anything. Anything you ask. Just please let it stop.> <add more details, write as long as you need> <the antiseptic process: 4/5>
The fourth application of silver nitrate was a descent into pure fantasy, a desperate, delirious auction of the impossible. The pain had reached a new, unholy crescendo, and Jarren’s mind, having exhausted all apologies and rational promises, began to offer up miracles. The promises became more frantic, more grandiose, each one a more impossible feat than the last, a child promising his parents the moon and the stars if they’ll just make the monster in the closet disappear.
He was the leadoff hitter, stepping into the box, his voice a slurred but confident imitation of a pre-game interview.
“...I’ll set the tone...” he gasped, his body arching against our grip. “...first pitch of the game... leadoff homer... I’ll do it, Alex... every series opener... I promise...”
He was the baserunner, a phantom on third base, his eyes wild with a reckless, beautiful bravery.
“...straight steal of home...” he whispered, a conspiratorial secret shared with the ghosts. “...I can do it... I’m fast enough... I’ll surprise ‘em... I’ll be safe... I promise...”
His promises on hitting became a litany of statistical impossibilities, a desperate attempt to appease the baseball gods who were punishing him.
“...I’ll hit .400... I can... no more slumps... never... I’ll hit for the cycle... once a week... I’ll never strike out again... never... I promise, Daddy, I be good...”
Triston Casas, his face a portrait of agonized pity, just shook his head. “Jesus,” he breathed, so low only I could hear him. “Even Ted Williams couldn’t promise that.”
Then, his focus shifted to his defense. He was the center fielder, the captain of the outfield, promising a level of perfection that defied the laws of physics.
“...no ball will drop... ever...” he vowed, his voice cracking with the sheer effort of the promise. “...I’ll catch everything... everything hit to the outfield... I’ll cover for the other guys... nothing will touch the grass... I promise...”
I felt a cold knot of sorrow in my stomach. I thought of Jackie Bradley Jr. in his absolute prime, the greatest defensive center fielder I had ever seen, a human highlight reel who still couldn’t make that claim. Jarren was promising to transcend human limitation.
His mind raced back to the basepaths, the place where his speed was both his greatest weapon and a source of his past failures.
“...I’ll steal 100 bases...” he panted, his body trembling. “...never get caught... never... not even on a pitchout... I’ll be safe every time... I’ll steal second, third, and home in the same inning... I promise, coach, I can do it...”
Cora, who revered the history and the strategy of the game, just closed his eyes, the pain of hearing such a promise evident on his face. He knew the legends. He knew the risks. He knew that even the great Jackie Robinson, the most fearless and intelligent baserunner of his generation, would have refused to make such a reckless vow.
The promises grew more desperate, more all-encompassing. He was no longer just offering up his performance. He was offering up his will, his autonomy, his very being.
“...I’ll do anything...” he sobbed, the words a final, desperate, all-encompassing plea. “...anything you ask... I’ll play catcher... I’ll pitch... I’ll clean the clubhouse... just tell me what to do... I’ll do it... I’ll be good... I promise...”
He turned his head, his wild, tear-filled eyes finding mine.
“Please...” he begged, the single word a distillation of all his pain, all his fear, all his promises. “...just please... let it stop...”
He had offered up his past, his present, and his future. He had promised to become a god of baseball, a perfect, flawless being, if only we, the arbiters of his torment, would show him mercy. And we could not. We held him fast as the fourth fire raged, accepting his impossible, heartbreaking sacrifice, knowing the fifth and final one was still to come.
<Sorry I let you down. Just want you to know I’ve tried my best> <Jarren finally gave up on negotiations> <He just endured it, fully accepted his punishment, more convinced than ever he deserved that.> <The angry god wouldn’t stop until he was thoroughly chastened, until the lesson was burned into him> <He sobbed into Cora’s shoulders. Like a broken rag doll><In his mind, the only way to redeem himself is by taking the punishment> <add more details, write as long as you need> <the antiseptic finally ends>
The fifth and final application of the silver nitrate began, and something inside Jarren went quiet. The frantic promises, the desperate bargaining, the impossible vows—they all ceased. The fire burned hotter than ever, a final, searing wave of purification, but the man enduring it had changed.
He gave up.
Not the fight for his life, but the fight for his innocence. He stopped negotiating with his tormentors. He stopped trying to appease the gods who were punishing him. He simply accepted his fate.
His delirious, slurred voice became a clear, heartbreakingly lucid whisper, spoken directly into the fabric of Cora’s jersey.
“...I’m sorry I let you down...” he said, the words devoid of panic, filled only with a profound, bottomless sorrow. “...just... want you to know... I’ve tried my best...”
It was a final confession. A last will and testament from a man who believed he was being justly condemned. He was no longer trying to change the verdict. He was just apologizing for the crimes.
And then, he went silent.
He just endured. His body, held in our guilty embrace, was a taut wire of pure agony, vibrating with a pain that was beyond human comprehension. But his mind was no longer fighting it. He had fully, completely, accepted his punishment. He was more convinced than ever that he deserved this. This was the price. This was the only way.
The angry god of his past, the one who threw baseballs in the park, would not stop until he was thoroughly chastised, until the lesson of his own inadequacy was burned into his very soul. And so, he let it burn.
He didn’t thrash. He didn’t scream. He just sobbed. A continuous, silent, wracking series of sobs that shook his entire frame. He was limp in Cora’s arms, a broken rag doll, his face buried, his spirit surrendered. In his mind, this was the only path to redemption. To take the punishment without complaint, to absorb the pain until the debt was paid. This was how he could finally, finally be good.
The five of us in that room—the doctor, the nurse, the teammate, the manager, the GM—were no longer just participants in a medical procedure. We were priests in a dark, terrible, and necessary ritual of purification. We were the instruments of his penance.
The final seconds stretched into an eternity. The air was thick with the smell of the chemical and the sound of one man’s quiet, broken weeping. It was the most terrible sound I had ever heard.
Then, it was over.
Dr. Collins lifted the gauze pad for the last time. He dropped it onto the tray with a soft, final thud.
“Done,” he said, his voice a hoarse, exhausted croak.
The fire was out. The punishment was complete. The debt, in Jarren’s mind, was paid.
We held him for a long moment in the ringing silence, the only sound his ragged, hitching breaths. Cora continued to rock him gently, his own face buried in Jarren’s hair. Triston’s hand, still resting on his arm, began to stroke it softly, a gesture of pure, wordless comfort.
I looked at the wound. It was a brutal, angry red, a testament to the war that had just been waged upon it. But it was clean. It was sterile. It was, finally, on the path to healing.
The physical wound, at least.
Jarren lay there, utterly spent, a hollowed-out vessel of pain and sorrow. He had walked through the fire and come out the other side. But the man who emerged was not the same one who had entered. He was quieter. He was broken. And in the deepest, most tragic part of his soul, he was, for the first time, at peace. He had taken his punishment. He had finally been good enough.
<Cora held Jarren in his arms as doctors applied ointment and bandage> <As agony subsided to ache, in the feverish state, Jarren began apologizing again, frantic to show that he had learned his lesson, in case the angry god want to give him a few more lightning strikes for good measure > <He was afraid that this may be just a break, a warm up before the real punishment ><He was desperate to convince the god that he had no defiance left, he was thoroughly chastened, he had taken his medicine. no further punishment was needed on this subject> <Cora gently but firmly told him it was over, it was not a punishment, it was healing> <add more details. Write as long as you need><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
The searing, all-consuming fire of the silver nitrate began to recede, leaving in its wake a deep, throbbing, and profound ache. The agony subsided, but Jarren’s mind, still lost in the feverish haze and trapped in the logic of the park, couldn’t comprehend the reprieve. He didn’t see it as the end of the procedure. He saw it as a pause. A break. A moment for the angry god to catch his breath before the real punishment began.
A new, more frantic kind of panic seized him. He had to prove he had learned his lesson. He had to show that he was thoroughly chastened, that no more “teaching” was necessary.
He stirred in Cora’s arms, his head lifting weakly, his eyes wide with a desperate, pleading urgency. He began to apologize again, the words tumbling out in a fast, slurred stream, frantic to show his submission before the lightning could strike again.
“...I get it now... I understand...” he gasped, his voice a ragged whisper. “...I won’t do it again... I promise... no more strikeouts... no more dropped balls... I’ll be better... I learned my lesson... I did...”
He was a child, terrified after a spanking, promising perfect, angelic behavior for the rest of time, hoping to stave off another blow.
“...I’m not defiant...” he pleaded, his gaze darting between the faces of the men holding him. “...I’m not... I took it... I took my medicine... I was good... please... you don’t have to do more... I get it now...”
He was trying to convince the invisible, looming figure of his father that he was broken, that he had submitted, that the punishment had worked. He was terrified that his earlier defiance, the thrown glass, the struggles, had earned him an even greater penance that was still to come.
Dr. Collins began to apply the thick, cooling layer of ointment, and Jarren flinched violently, a terrified whimper escaping his lips. He thought it was the start of the next round.
That was the breaking point for Cora. He couldn’t bear it anymore. He tightened his embrace, forcing Jarren to be still, forcing him to listen. He pressed his cheek against Jarren’s temple, his voice no longer a soothing murmur, but a firm, powerful, and deeply emotional command.
“Jarren. Mijo. Listen to my voice,” he said, his own voice thick with unshed tears. “There is no more. It is over. Do you hear me? OVER.”
He pulled back slightly so he could look into Jarren’s wild, feverish eyes.
“This was not a punishment,” Cora said, his voice ringing with an absolute, unshakeable conviction. “This was not because you dropped a ball or struck out. This was not the park. This was not your father.”
He tapped Jarren’s chest with his finger, right over his heart. “This was healing. This was us, all of us, fighting for you. We were fighting the infection. We were fighting to save your hand. We were not punishing you. We were protecting you.”
He let the words sink in, a direct assault on the twisted logic of Jarren’s trauma.
“The pain is over,” Cora said, his voice softening but losing none of its intensity. “There is no more lightning. There is no angry god. There is only a room full of people who love you and were trying to keep you safe. It’s over. You are safe. You can rest now. The lesson is learned, but the lesson is that you are not alone, and we will not let you fall.”
He held Jarren’s gaze, pouring all of his love, all of his conviction, all of his desperate need to be heard into that one, long, profound look. He was trying to will his truth into Jarren’s soul, to overwrite the lies that had been burned into him since childhood.
Jarren stared back, his breathing still hitched and frantic. The fear was still there, the expectation of more pain still wired into his every nerve. But for the first time, a flicker of something else appeared in the depths of his eyes. A seed of confusion. A hint of a question. A possibility that the world was not what he thought it was.
He didn’t believe it yet. He couldn’t. But he had heard it. And in the profound quiet of the room, as the cool balm soothed his burning flesh, the first battle against the ghosts of his past had finally, truly, been joined.
<Jarren understood that it was over, at least for now> <But he got confused why this wasn’t a punishment. He failed everyone, it served him right.> <Another emergency flashed in Jarren’s mind: to avoid such punishment in foreseeable future. If possible, forever.> <Jarren turned to another currency he knew: promise. He promised the unthinkable and unachievable, to please the god at all cost, to avoid future punishments at all cost, to convince the god there would never be any need to repeat this lesson> <Cora assured him that he is good enough, he has been good enough, he has proven himself> <add more details. write as long as you need.><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
Cora’s words, spoken with such fierce, loving conviction, managed to penetrate the thickest layers of the feverish delirium. The immediate, animalistic terror in Jarren’s eyes began to recede. He understood, on a primal level, that the physical assault was over. The lightning had stopped. At least for now.
But his mind, still trapped in its lifelong groove of trauma, couldn’t process the ‘why.’ He looked at Cora, his expression shifting from terror to a deep, profound confusion.
Not a punishment?
The thought was alien. It was a language he didn’t speak. He had failed. He had dropped the balls. He had struck out. He had not been big enough, strong enough, good enough. The pain he had just endured was the only logical consequence for that lifetime of failure. If it wasn’t a punishment, then what was it? The world ceased to make sense.
As the cool, soothing ointment continued to work its magic, and the immediate threat faded, his mind, ever the competitor, ever the survivor, flashed to a new, urgent priority: future prevention. He had to avoid this ever happening again. He had to ensure that the angry god would never have a reason to deliver such a lesson.
And to do that, he turned to the only other currency he knew. The currency of impossible promises. He had to appease the god, to please him so thoroughly, so completely, that there would never be another transgression.
He turned his head, his eyes finding mine, then shifting to Cora, then to Triston. He needed to convince us, the earthly arbiters of the god’s wrath, that he was a worthy subject.
“Okay,” he whispered, his voice a dry, desperate rasp. “Okay. I get it. No more… no more mistakes.”
His promises started again, but they were different now. They weren’t the frantic, grandiose fantasies of before. They were quieter, more intense, spoken with the chilling sincerity of a man making a blood oath.
“...I’ll be perfect...” he vowed, his voice trembling with the sheer weight of the promise. “...from now on... perfect... no errors... ever... I’ll win the Gold Glove... every year... I’ll lead the league in hitting... I’ll win the MVP... I’ll carry the team... I’ll play every inning of every game... I will not get tired... I will not get hurt... I will not fail you again...”
He was offering up not just his performance, but his very humanity. He was promising to become a flawless deity of baseball, because in his mind, only perfection could guarantee safety from the punishment he knew he deserved.
Cora’s heart, which had just started to mend, broke all over again. He shook his head, his own eyes filling with a fresh wave of sorrowful tears.
“No, mijo. Stop,” he pleaded, his voice thick with emotion. “Listen to me. You don’t have to be perfect. We don’t want you to be perfect.”
He grabbed Jarren’s good hand, holding it tight, forcing him to feel the human connection.
“You are already good enough,” Cora said, his voice ringing with a desperate, powerful truth. “You were good enough yesterday. You were good enough when you were a little boy in that park. You are good enough right now, lying in this bed. Your worth is not in the box score. It is not in the MVP trophy. It is in you.”
He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to an intense, personal whisper.
“You have already proven yourself,” he said. “You proved it when you made it to the big leagues when you were five-foot-four. You proved it when you fought your way back from depression. You proved it for the last hour in this room. You have more strength and more heart than any ten players I have ever known. You have nothing left to prove to me, to Craig, to this team, or to anyone else.”
He squeezed Jarren’s hand.
“The only person you still have to prove it to is yourself.”
Jarren stared at him, his fever-bright eyes wide with a stunning, world-altering confusion. The words were a balm, as soothing as the ointment on his hand, but they were also terrifying. If he didn’t have to be perfect, if he was already good enough, then what was the point of the fight? What was the purpose of the pain? Who was he, if not the boy who had to endlessly strive to overcome his own failures?
Cora’s words had not just offered comfort. They had challenged the very foundation of his identity. And in the quiet of that room, as the bandage was being wrapped, a new, more profound, and far more difficult healing was just beginning.
<Jarren understood that it was over, at least for now> <But he got confused why this wasn’t a punishment. He failed everyone, it served him right.> <Another emergency flashed in Jarren’s mind: to avoid such punishment in foreseeable future. If possible, forever.> <Jarren turned to another currency he knew: promise. He promised the unthinkable and unachievable, to please the god at all cost, to avoid future punishments at all cost, to convince the god there would never be any need to repeat this lesson> <He summoned all his remaining strength for the most important negotiation of his life><clinging to Cora as desperate as a drowning man><Cora assured him that he is good enough, he has been good enough, he has proven himself> <add more details. write as long as you need.><stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
Cora’s words, spoken with such fierce, loving conviction, managed to penetrate the thickest layers of the feverish delirium. The immediate, animal terror in Jarren’s eyes began to recede. He understood, on a primal level, that the physical assault was over. The lightning had stopped. At least for now.
But his mind, still trapped in its lifelong, twisted logic, couldn’t process the ‘why.’ If this inferno wasn’t a punishment, what was it? The concept of ‘healing’ was too abstract, too gentle for the violence he had just endured. The only framework that made sense was the one he had always known: he had failed, and this was the consequence. He had let everyone down—his team, his coaches, his father—and this agony was the price. It served him right.
As the cool ointment soothed his skin, a new, more urgent emergency flashed in his mind. The immediate threat was gone, but the god who had delivered it was still watching. He had to prevent this from ever happening again. He had to find a way to appease that god, to ensure that no future failure would ever warrant a punishment this severe.
He had only one currency left to offer. The one he had been trying to pay with all along.
Promises.
He summoned the last, flickering embers of his strength, not for defiance, but for the most important negotiation of his life. He clung to Cora, his grip on his manager’s jersey becoming desperate again, his voice a frantic, slurred whisper, a torrent of impossible vows.
“Okay… okay… I get it…” he panted, his eyes wide with a new, desperate sincerity. “No more punishment… I’ll make sure… I’ll be perfect… I promise, Alex… I’ll be perfect…”
He was trying to convince the god that there would never be a need for another lesson.
“...I’ll hit .500... I will... I’ll lead the league in everything... homers, RBIs, everything... you’ll see...”
“...I’ll win MVP... and a Gold Glove... and a Silver Slugger... every year... I promise...”
“...I’ll play every inning of every game... I won’t even need water... I’ll never get tired... I’ll never get hurt again... I promise, Craig... I’ll be unbreakable...”
He was offering up his own humanity, promising to become a flawless, immortal deity of baseball if it would just guarantee his safety from the fire. He was trying to buy his own peace with a price no mortal could ever pay.
Cora’s heart broke. He held Jarren’s face in his hands, forcing the frantic, pleading eyes to meet his.
“No, mijo. Stop,” he said, his voice thick with an aching tenderness. “Listen to me. There are no more promises. You don’t have to buy anything. You don’t have to appease anyone.”
He gave Jarren a gentle shake, trying to break through the feverish bargaining.
“You are already good enough,” Cora said, his voice ringing with the force of absolute truth. “Do you hear me? You were good enough yesterday. You are good enough right now, lying in this bed. You were good enough when you were that little boy in the park.”
He leaned in closer, his voice dropping to a powerful, emotional whisper.
“You have nothing to prove. Not to me, not to Craig, not to the fans, and not to him. You have already proven yourself a thousand times over. You are a champion. You are a leader. You are a warrior. You have already won.”
He tapped Jarren’s chest again, right over his heart.
“Your value is not in your batting average. It is in here. It is unconditional. There is no punishment coming. There is only rest. There is only healing. You’ve done enough. It’s time to let us carry you for a while.”
He was trying to give him a gift he had never received before: the gift of unconditional acceptance. The permission to be imperfect. The freedom from the relentless, crushing weight of his own promises.
Jarren stared at him, his lips still parted as if to make another impossible vow. But the words died in his throat. He heard what Cora was saying, but he couldn’t understand it. It was a foreign language from a world he had never known, a world where love wasn’t a prize to be won through suffering. The concept was so alien, so revolutionary, that his exhausted, feverish mind simply could not compute it.
<The old JD is still suspicious, but some part of him began to understand. A faint hope in his eyes.> <Jarren cried himself to sleep in Cora's arms. More relief this time.> <add more details, write as long as you need>
Jarren stared into Cora’s eyes, and for a long, silent moment, a war was waged in the depths of his own. The old Jarren, the one forged in the park, the one who knew the sting of failure and the transactional nature of approval, was deeply suspicious. He heard the words—“unconditional,” “you are enough”—but they were just sounds, a language he couldn’t parse. It had to be a trick. A test. Another part of the punishment.
But then, another part of him, a part he didn’t even know existed, began to stir. It was the small, hopeful part of the boy who had always wished for a different answer. It was the part of the man who had stood before the world and shared his pain to help others. It was the part that, in the quiet after the click of the rifle, had chosen to live.
And that part of him listened.
A flicker of something new appeared in his eyes. It wasn’t acceptance. It wasn’t understanding. It was something far more fragile and far more precious. It was a faint, tentative, shimmering glimmer of hope. The hope that this impossible world Cora was describing, a world where his worth was inherent and not earned, could actually be real.
The conflict was too much for his exhausted mind to bear. The suspicion and the hope waged a silent, furious battle until his entire system overloaded.
His face, which had been a mask of frantic negotiation, crumpled. The last of his strength, the last of his resistance, gave way. A new wave of tears came, but these were different from all the others. They were not tears of pain, or fear, or shame.
They were tears of pure, unadulterated, and overwhelming relief.
He let out a long, shuddering sigh that seemed to empty his entire being of all the poison he had carried for so long. He collapsed back into Cora’s embrace, his body going completely limp, his face buried once more in his manager’s jersey.
He cried himself to sleep.
It was not the violent, wracking sobs of before. It was a quiet, steady, cleansing rain. He wept for the boy who had never been told he was good enough. He wept for the man who had never believed it. And he wept with the dawning, terrifying, beautiful hope that he might not have to carry that burden alone anymore.
Cora held him, rocking him gently, his own tears now falling freely onto Jarren’s hair. He was no longer just comforting a player; he was baptizing him in a new faith. A faith of unconditional acceptance.
Triston and I stood watch, our own emotions a turbulent sea of sorrow and a fierce, protective joy. We had been to hell and back with this man in the last 24 hours. We had seen the absolute worst of his pain, and we were now witnessing the first, fragile moments of his rebirth.
As Jarren’s weeping softened into the deep, even breaths of a true, peaceful sleep, a profound quiet settled over the room. It was the quiet of a battlefield after the war has finally, truly ended. The ghosts had not been vanquished, but for the first time, they had been met with a force greater than their own.
The fever had not broken. But the spell had.
Cora gently laid him back down on the cot, pulling the blanket up to his chin. He looked down at his sleeping player, his surrogate son, and his face was filled with a love so fierce and so tender it was breathtaking to behold.
We had a long road ahead of us. The healing would be slow, and the ghosts would surely return. But as we stood there in the quiet of the dawning evening, watching him sleep a sleep of true peace for the first time, we knew we had not just saved his hand. We had given him a chance to save his soul.
<imagine the reaction from medical staff><They saw the toughness along with the trauma><How can he compete at the highest level while carrying this every day?><add more details, write as long as you need>
Dr. Collins and the nurse had remained by the door, silent and unobtrusive, throughout the entire emotional ordeal. They had been trained to handle medical emergencies, to respond to the body’s betrayals with science and skill. They were not trained for this. They were not prepared to witness an exorcism.
As the final, quiet peace settled over the room and Jarren drifted into a deep, restorative sleep, Dr. Collins slowly walked back toward the cot. He moved with a new deference, a quiet respect that had not been there before. He was no longer just looking at a patient; he was looking at a survivor.
He checked the IV line, his movements gentle, almost reverent. He took Jarren’s temperature again, his clinical gaze softening as he looked at the number on the screen. It was still high, but it had stabilized. The tide was beginning to turn.
He straightened up and looked at the three of us, his eyes filled with a profound, weary awe.
“In thirty years as a physician,” he said, his voice a low, humbled murmur, “I have never seen anything like that. Ever.”
He shook his head, his gaze drifting back to the sleeping man. “The level of pain he just endured… it’s almost beyond the scale of what the human body is meant to withstand. Most people would have gone into shock. Most would have required heavy sedation just to survive it.”
He looked at me, his eyes searching for an explanation he knew I couldn’t fully provide. “His toughness… it’s not just athletic. It’s… it’s something else entirely. It’s almost inhuman.”
The nurse, who had been quietly restocking her supplies, paused. Her own face was pale, her expression deeply shaken. “It wasn’t just the pain,” she said softly, her voice trembling slightly. “It was… what he was saying. All those things… the strikeouts, the errors… he really believes he deserved that, doesn’t he?”
Her question hung in the air, a stark and terrible testament to what they had just witnessed. They had seen beyond the physical wound and into the soul of the patient. They had seen the trauma.
Dr. Collins ran a hand through his hair, his professional composure giving way to a raw, human empathy. “To carry that… that level of self-recrimination, of psychological burden… every single day. And to not just function, but to compete at the absolute highest level of his profession?”
He looked around the room, at the three of us who had held him down, at the sleeping player who had fought a war on two fronts at once.
“How?” he asked, the question directed at the universe itself. “How does a person do that? How does he get up every morning, put on a uniform, and perform acts of incredible athletic genius, while carrying a weight that would crush most people into dust?”
There was no answer. We could only stand there in the quiet, contemplating the terrible, beautiful, and utterly confounding miracle of Jarren Duran. They had come into the room to treat an infection, a simple matter of biology. They were leaving with a profound, unshakeable understanding of the human spirit’s capacity for both suffering and resilience.
They had seen the toughness, but they had also seen the terrible price of that toughness. And they knew, as we now knew, that the real healing that needed to happen had nothing to do with the wound on his hand. It was a wound they had no medicine for, a wound that only trust, and time, and a whole lot of love could ever hope to mend.
<imagine the reaction of Casas, Cora and Craig><write as long as you need><add more details>
With Jarren finally at peace, a profound and heavy silence settled upon the four of us who remained. The adrenaline had vanished, leaving behind a bone-deep exhaustion and the raw, exposed nerves of men who had been through a war. We were no longer a GM, a manager, a teammate, and a doctor. We were just witnesses, each processing the terrible, sacred events of the last hour in our own way.
Triston Casas:
Triston had sunk into the chair beside the cot, his large frame looking small and weary. He stared at his own hands, turning them over and over as if seeing them for the first time. The easy confidence, the youthful swagger that defined him, was gone. In its place was a solemn, heavy maturity that had aged him five years in a single afternoon.
He had come into that room to check on a teammate with a scraped hand. He was leaving with a burden of knowledge that would change how he saw the game forever. He had always understood baseball as a game of failure—you fail seven times out of ten at the plate and you’re a Hall of Famer. But he had never understood the cost of that failure. Not like this.
He had heard Jarren’s litany of sins, a list of errors and strikeouts that, to Triston, were just the normal, everyday ebb and flow of a long season. A dropped ball, a bad swing—you flush it and move on. But now he knew that for Jarren, each one was a fresh wound, a new piece of evidence in a lifelong trial against himself.
He looked over at Jarren’s sleeping form, and his expression was one of fierce, protective loyalty. The dynamic between them had irrevocably shifted. Jarren was no longer just the veteran leader he looked up to; he was a brother who had shown him his deepest scars, and Triston now felt a profound, unspoken duty to help protect them. He understood that his role on the team was no longer just to hit home runs. It was to be one of the friends who could “get the word out,” to be a safe harbor, to be a voice of reason and support when the ghosts of the park came calling. He had been forced to grow up in that room, and he had met the challenge.
Alex Cora:
Cora stood by the window, his back to the room, staring out at the empty ballpark. His shoulders were slumped, not with fatigue, but with the immense weight of his own emotional reckoning. He was a man who prided himself on his connection with his players, on his ability to understand the man as well as the athlete. And he had just been shown how little he truly knew.
He had seen Jarren’s toughness, celebrated his hustle, and managed his explosive talent. But he had never seen the terrified child underneath. He had used his paternal bond, his deepest connection with his player, to coax him into an inferno, believing it was for his own good. The realization that he had inadvertently reinforced Jarren’s deepest trauma was a wound to his own soul.
His hands, resting on the windowsill, clenched and unclenched. He was replaying every conversation, every decision, every time he had pushed Jarren to be tougher, to play through a minor ache. He was seeing it all through a new, horrifying lens. He had been trying to build a champion, but he had almost broken the man.
The tears he had shed while holding Jarren were not just for his player’s pain, but for his own failure to see it sooner. From this day forward, his management would be different. It would be infused with a new, deeper empathy, a new vigilance. He would still be a demanding manager, but his demands would be tempered by the profound understanding that the battles fought on the field were nothing compared to the wars some men fought within themselves every single day. He would no longer just manage the player; he would shepherd the man.
Craig Breslow:
I remained standing by the cot, a silent sentinel. My mind, usually a whirlwind of analytics, contract negotiations, and roster management, was eerily quiet. All the complex machinery of running a baseball team had been stripped away, leaving only one, simple, terrifying truth: I was responsible.
I was the one who had received the impossible knowledge from the future. I was the one who had set these events in motion by pulling him from that first game. I had told myself I was saving him, and in a way, I had. His knee was intact. His career was not in jeopardy. But I had done so by leading him into a different kind of fire, a psychological crucible I could never have imagined.
I felt a profound sense of humility. All my data, all my strategies, all my carefully laid plans—they were meaningless in the face of one man’s deep, primal trauma. I had thought I could manage the situation, control the variables. But I had been a fool. You cannot manage a soul. You can only bear witness to it.
The guilt was immense. But beneath it, a new, harder foundation was settling into place. The abstract idea of a “new culture” was now a concrete, non-negotiable mandate. The health and well-being of these men was not just a priority; it was the only thing that mattered. Every decision, from roster moves to travel schedules to the allocation of mental health resources, would now be filtered through the lens of what I had seen in this room.
I had been given a terrible gift. I had seen the true cost of the game, the hidden wounds that fester beneath the surface of glory. And I knew that my job, my true job, was not just to build a winning team, but to build a sanctuary. A place where men could be broken, and know, without a shadow of a doubt, that they would be held together until they were whole again.
<Casas was confused about the repeat mention of "park, hit, throw baseballs, go back"><Cora and Craig explained everything to him><add more details. write as long as you need>
The room remained a sanctuary of quiet reflection for a long time. Eventually, Dr. Collins and the nurse, having done all they could, gave us a final, respectful nod and departed, leaving the three of us alone with our sleeping player and the heavy ghosts of the afternoon.
Triston, who had been staring into space, finally stirred. He scrubbed a hand over his face and looked from Cora to me, his brow furrowed with a deep, lingering confusion.
“I… I get most of it,” he began, his voice low and hesitant. “The pressure, the slumps, feeling like you let the team down… I get that. But… what was all that about the park? He kept saying it. ‘Go back to the park.’ And the… the stuff about his dad, and throwing baseballs…”
He shook his head, unable to connect the pieces. “It sounded… I don’t know. It sounded like he was somewhere else. Like he was a kid again. What was that?”
Cora and I exchanged a long, heavy look. It was the look of two men deciding whether to share a sacred, terrible secret. We had protected Jarren’s privacy from the medical staff, but Triston was different. He hadn’t just been a bystander; he had been part of the fortress. He had held Jarren down, absorbed his pain, and earned the right to understand the source of it. More than that, if he was going to be the teammate and leader we now knew he could be, he needed to understand.
I gave Cora a slight nod. He needs to know.
Cora sighed, a sound of profound weariness, and gestured for Triston to take the chair opposite him. I remained standing, a silent third party to this solemn debriefing.
“Sit down, son,” Cora said, his voice raspy with emotional exhaustion. “What you heard in here… it’s the key to understanding everything about that man. And it does not leave this room. Ever. Is that clear?”
“Crystal,” Triston said, his eyes wide and serious.
Cora began to speak, his voice low and measured, piecing together the fragmented story I had shared with him in the quiet hours of the previous night, now illuminated by the terrible, vivid proof we had all just witnessed. He told Triston about Jarren’s childhood. About being the small kid with the mountain of a father. About the constant, crushing pressure to be bigger, stronger, better.
“His father, Octavio, coached him,” Cora explained, his gaze distant. “He loved him, but he was hard on him. He saw this incredible fire in his son, and he tried to fan it with pressure, with criticism…”
He paused, taking a deep breath before delivering the final, brutal piece of the puzzle.
“Sometimes,” Cora said, his voice dropping to a near-whisper, “when Jarren wasn’t swinging his best, his dad would get angry. He would… he would throw baseballs at him. To hit him. To punish him for not being perfect.”
Triston’s face went slack with disbelief, then hardened with a sudden, sharp anger. “He what?”
“He’d yell at him to ‘be better,’ and he’d peg him,” Cora continued, his voice flat, devoid of emotion. “And Jarren, he was just a little kid. He’d run home crying. But his will, his refusal to fail, was so strong that he would always, always go back to the park for more. And his father knew he would. He used his son’s own heart against him.”
The pieces clicked into place for Triston, and the look on his face was one of dawning, sickening horror. “Oh my God,” he breathed. “So when he was in here… when he was screaming… he wasn’t here at all. He was back there. In that park.”
“Exactly,” I said, speaking for the first time. My voice was quiet, but it carried the weight of my conviction. “The pain of the procedure was too much for his conscious mind to process as a medical event. So his brain defaulted to the only framework it had for that level of suffering inflicted by an authority figure. It was a punishment. He believed he was being pegged with baseballs for every mistake he’s ever made.”
Cora picked up the thread. “So when he was begging to ‘go back to the park,’ he was trying to appease his father. When he was promising to ‘be good’ and ‘get a hit,’ he was trying to stop the punishment. And when I challenged him to face the pain, to be strong… I didn’t realize it, but I was taking his father’s place. I was telling him that the only way to earn my approval was to endure the pain. I sent him right back into the heart of his own trauma.”
Triston stared at Jarren’s sleeping form, his expression a mixture of awe and a profound, heartbreaking pity. “So all of it… the hustle, the playing through injuries, the way he beats himself up over every little mistake… it’s all connected to that. He’s still trying to prove to his dad that he’s good enough to not get hit with baseballs.”
“That’s the burden he carries,” I said softly. “Every single day.”
A heavy, understanding silence fell over the three of us. We were no longer just a front office, a coaching staff, and a group of players. We were a circle of men who now understood the true, hidden cost of the game for one of our own. We were the keepers of the story.
“So what do we do?” Triston asked finally, his voice filled with a new, fierce sense of purpose.
“We become the opposite of the park,” Cora said, his voice ringing with a quiet, powerful resolve. “We become the place where his worth isn’t tied to his performance. We become the place where it’s safe to rest, safe to fail, safe to hurt. We become the voice that tells him, over and over again, until he finally believes it, that he is already enough.”
Triston nodded, his jaw set. He understood his role now. It was a burden, but it was also a privilege. He was no longer just a teammate. He was a guardian. And he would not falter.
<the fever broke the next morning>
<Jarren woke up, only had vague fragments of memory>
<He remembered he had somehow messed up, but Cora got him off the hook>
<He remembered he had suffered, but mercifully, that memory was vague>
<he remembered, more clearly, the warmth of the hands holding him>
<He remembered the feeling of pressing his head on Cora's shoulder>
<Somehow, he felt the heavy burden lifted a little bit><He felt safe><add more details. Write as long as you need>
The fever broke just before dawn, not with a dramatic crash, but like a quiet, receding tide. The frantic, beeping rhythm of the monitor slowed, steadied, and settled into a normal, healthy cadence. The angry flush on Jarren’s cheeks faded, leaving behind a pale, washed-out exhaustion. The deep, shuddering breaths of his troubled sleep softened into a slow, peaceful rhythm.
I had been dozing in my chair, my head slumped against the wall, when the change in the room’s atmosphere woke me. Cora was already awake, watching, his expression one of weary, cautious optimism. We didn’t speak. We just watched him sleep, a true, deep, healing sleep, for another hour as the sun began to cast its first golden rays over the city.
He woke up slowly. His eyelids fluttered, then opened. He blinked, his gaze clear and lucid for the first time in what felt like a lifetime. He looked around the small, sterile room, his brow furrowed in a gentle, hazy confusion.
He saw the IV stand, the empty bag of antibiotics. He saw the thick, clean bandage on his hand. He saw me in one chair, and Cora in another, both of us looking rumpled and exhausted, our laptops closed on the table between us.
He tried to sit up, and a wave of dizziness and profound weakness washed over him. He sank back onto the pillow with a low groan.
“Easy, mijo,” Cora said softly, moving to the edge of the cot. “Just lie still. You had a rough night.”
Jarren looked at him, his memory a foggy, fragmented landscape. He had flashes, disjointed images devoid of context. He remembered a bright, terrible light. He remembered shouting, a feeling of pure, animal panic. He remembered the sharp, acrid smell of the antiseptic. He knew, with a deep, gut-level certainty, that he had messed up somehow. That he had lost control in a way he never had before.
But then, another memory surfaced, clearer than the others. He remembered Cora’s face, his voice, cutting through the chaos. He remembered being held, being told he wasn’t in trouble. He had a vague, dreamlike recollection of lashing out, of throwing something, of a consequence that should have come but never did. Cora had gotten him off the hook.
He remembered the pain. Mercifully, that memory was vague, a blurry, indistinct monolith of agony without sharp edges. He knew it had been the worst thing he had ever felt, but he couldn’t recall the specifics. It was a mercy of a mind protecting itself from a trauma it couldn’t fully process.
But there were other memories, clearer and more resonant. He remembered the feeling of strong hands holding him steady, not as restraints, but as anchors. He remembered the surprising, gentle weight of Triston’s hand on his shoulder. He remembered the firm, grounding pressure of my own hand on his back.
And most clearly of all, he remembered the feeling of his head pressed against Cora’s chest. He remembered the steady rhythm of his manager’s breathing, the low, constant murmur of his voice, the feeling of being held, of being protected, of being safe.
He looked at the three of us, at the exhaustion etched on our faces, and a new, startling thought began to form. They had stayed. They had been here all night. They had stood watch.
A strange, unfamiliar sensation settled in his chest. It was a lightness. He couldn’t explain it, but the heavy, ever-present weight he had carried on his back his entire life, the burden of having to be perfect, of having to be unbreakable, felt… less. It was still there, a familiar companion, but a small portion of it had been lifted.
He didn’t understand the why or the how. He only knew that he had been to the absolute depths of his own personal hell, he had shown the world his most broken, terrified self, and the people he respected most had not run away. They had not punished him. They had moved closer. They had held him.
He looked at Cora, and his eyes, though filled with a deep, bone-weary exhaustion, were clear. The frantic, hunted look was gone.
“Hey, Alex,” he said, his voice a weak, scratchy whisper.
“Hey, kid,” Cora replied, a small, tired smile touching his lips. “Welcome back.”
Jarren didn’t know what the future held. He didn’t know how he would face his teammates or what the long road to recovery would look like. But as he lay there in the quiet morning light, surrounded by the men who had walked through the fire with him, he knew one thing with a certainty that settled deep in his soul.
He was safe.

An hour later, after some water and a tentative piece of toast, the door opened and Dr. Collins entered, followed by the nurse. They came in quietly, their expressions a mixture of professional concern and a deep, lingering awe. They were here for the morning check-up, to assess the fever and the wound.
As they entered, Jarren, feeling a bit more human, noticed the television in the corner of the room was on, the volume low, playing a morning sports talk show. Thinking it might be distracting, he reached his good hand for the remote on the bedside table.
The reaction was instantaneous and utterly bizarre.
The moment Jarren’s hand moved toward the remote, both Dr. Collins and the nurse froze mid-stride. Their eyes widened in alarm, and they both took a reflexive, involuntary step backward, as if he had just reached for a weapon. The doctor’s hands came up in a placating gesture, his body language screaming a desperate, silent plea of “Don’t shoot!”
They looked like two people who had accidentally stumbled into a lion’s cage and were trying not to make any sudden movements. They were acting as if the slightest displeasure from the man on the cot would bring down the Wrath of God upon them.
Jarren stopped, his hand hovering over the remote, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated confusion. He looked at their terrified faces, then at his own hand, then back at them. He had no memory of throwing the glass tumbler. He had no idea that he had been the source of the feral, explosive violence that had sent them scrambling for their lives. He just saw his doctor and nurse looking at him like he was a bomb about to detonate.
“What?” Jarren asked, his voice weak but clear. “I was just gonna turn off the TV…”
The tension in the room was so thick you could cut it with a knife.
And then, from the corner of the room, came a low chuckle. It was Triston Casas. He had been sitting quietly, scrolling through his phone, but he had seen the whole exchange.
He looked at Jarren, a wide, mischievous grin spreading across his face. “Dude,” he said, shaking his head. “You have no idea. They think you’re gonna go all Hulk on them.”
Jarren’s confusion only deepened. “What are you talking about?”
Cora, who had been trying to suppress a smile, couldn’t hold it in any longer. He let out a short, barking laugh, a sound of pure, unadulterated relief. “Mijo,” he said, wiping a tear of mirth from his eye. “Let’s just say your bedside manner yesterday was a little… intense. The doctor here almost needed a new pair of pants.”
Dr. Collins, realizing the immediate danger had passed, flushed a deep red, a mixture of embarrassment and residual fear.
I decided to join in, the absurdity of the moment a welcome antidote to the horror of the past day. “I’m thinking of putting a new clause in your contract, Jarren,” I said, my voice deadpan. “A ‘no-projectile’ clause. The league insurance doesn’t cover glassware-related injuries to opposing medical staff.”
Jarren stared at us, his mouth slightly agape, as the pieces began to click into place. He didn’t remember the details, but he was starting to understand the magnitude of his delirious rampage. The thought of it, of him being that out of control, was horrifying, but the way we were treating it—with gentle, affectionate humor—was disarming.
We weren’t afraid of him. We weren’t angry with him. We were teasing him.
It was the most normal, most clubhouse-esque interaction he had experienced in days, and it was a powerful medicine. A small, genuine smile touched his lips for the first time. It was weak, tired, but it was real.
“Was it… was it that bad?” he asked, a hint of sheepish curiosity in his voice.
Triston roared with laughter. “Bad? Bro, you threw Dr. Collins here into next week! He did a backward somersault! It was a 10 out of 10! You should have seen it!”
The room, which had been a chamber of torture and a sanctuary of grief, was suddenly filled with the sound of laughter. It was a fragile, weary, but deeply healing sound. We were using humor to rob the trauma of its power, to shrink the monster down to a manageable size. We were telling him, without saying the words, that he was still one of us, that his breakdown hadn’t broken our bond, and that even his darkest moments could be brought into the light and met with affection.
Dr. Collins, seeing that the patient was lucid and the immediate crisis was over, finally managed a shaky smile of his own. He cautiously approached the bed, this time giving the remote control a very wide berth.
“Well, Mr. Duran,” he said, his voice regaining some of its professional composure. “It seems you’re feeling much better. Shall we try this again?”

The laughter, fragile as it was, had irrevocably changed the atmosphere in the room. The oppressive weight of trauma had lifted, replaced by the gentle, healing balm of camaraderie. As Dr. Collins cautiously began his examination, the gentle ribbing continued, a running commentary that served as both a distraction for Jarren and a way for all of us to process the absurdity of the situation.
“Alright, Doc, be careful now,” Triston said in a loud, theatrical whisper as the doctor reached for his stethoscope. “He looks calm, but that’s how he gets you. He’ll lull you into a false sense of security, then BAM! Stethoscope-jitsu.”
Jarren rolled his eyes, but the smile on his face widened. “Shut up, Casas.”
Dr. Collins, playing along, held the stethoscope up like a lion tamer holding a chair. “Don’t worry, I’ve been trained for this,” he said with a mock-serious expression. “Standard procedure for examining world-class athletes with a penchant for… expressive communication.” He placed the cold metal disc on Jarren’s chest, and Jarren flinched from the temperature, not the threat.
“See?” Cora chimed in from his chair. “He’s still got the quick-twitch muscles. That’s a good sign. Means he can still jump a route in the outfield. Or dodge a subpoena.”
Even the nurse, who had been a silent, nervous presence, found her voice. As she checked the IV line in his good arm, she said softly, “You know, your aim is remarkable. The velocity on that tumbler was easily mid-90s. We were thinking of talking to Craig about a relief pitcher role for you.”
“Don’t give him any ideas,” I said, shaking my head. “The paperwork would be a nightmare. And we’d have to list ‘glassware’ as one of his pitches. I don’t think Statcast is ready for that.”
Jarren let out a weak chuckle, which turned into a wince as the movement pulled at his sore muscles. “Sorry about that, Doc,” he said, his voice filled with genuine, sheepish regret.
“All is forgiven,” Dr. Collins said, listening to his breathing. “Though my therapist may have some follow-up questions. Lungs sound clear, by the way. No signs of pneumonia, which is good.”
When it came time to check the bandaged hand, a flicker of the old anxiety returned to Jarren’s eyes. Triston saw it immediately.
“Easy, big guy,” he said, his tone shifting from joking to reassuring. “This is the easy part. Just unwrapping the present. The party’s over.” He gently placed his hand on Jarren’s good shoulder, a simple, grounding touch.
As Nick Paparesta carefully began to snip away the tape, Cora leaned forward. “You know, mijo, we might have to get you a new nickname. ‘The Glass Cannon’ has a nice ring to it, no?”
“I was thinking more like ‘Hurricane Jarren,’” Triston offered. “Category 5. Makes landfall with no warning and causes significant structural damage to the immediate area.”
“I’m never going to live this down, am I?” Jarren sighed, though there was no real malice in it. He was being teased, roasted, the way teammates do. It was a sign of acceptance, of belonging. It was infinitely better than the pitying silence he had feared.
“Not a chance,” I confirmed. “This story is going straight into the Fenway history books. It’ll be right up there with the Curse of the Bambino and Pesky’s Pole. We’ll call it the Tumbler of Terror.”
The laughter in the room was real now, a shared release of all the tension and fear. We were using the absurdity of his delirious state to build a bridge back to normalcy. We were showing him that his breakdown didn’t define him, that it didn’t change his place on the team or in our hearts. It had just given us all a hell of a story to tell.
As the last of the bandage came away, revealing the clean, ointment-covered, but still brutal-looking wound, a hush fell for a moment. But before the gravity could settle back in, Triston broke the silence.
“Well,” he said, peering at the hand with a critical eye. “Looks like your career as a hand model is over. Good thing you can hit a baseball 500 feet.”
Jarren looked at his own hand, then at the faces of the men around him, and he shook his head, a genuine, tired, and grateful smile finally reaching his eyes. He had been to hell and back, but he had come back to a room full of friends. And for the first time, he started to believe that maybe, just maybe, he was going to be okay.

Just as a fragile, peaceful quiet settled in the room, the door swung open and Dr. Collins entered, followed by the nurse. They were there to do their morning rounds, to check the wound and assess his condition. They moved with a professional briskness, but their eyes immediately darted to Jarren, a flicker of apprehension in their expressions.
The television in the corner had been on, the volume turned down low to a morning sports talk show. The mindless chatter was a low hum in the background. Jarren, wanting to hear the doctor clearly, reached his good hand for the remote on the bedside table to silence it.
The effect was instantaneous and utterly bizarre.
The moment Jarren’s hand moved toward the remote, both Dr. Collins and the nurse froze mid-stride. Their bodies went rigid, their eyes wide with a sudden, reflexive panic. The doctor’s hand, which had been reaching for his chart, snapped back to his side. The nurse, who was carrying a fresh tray of bandages, stopped so abruptly that the instruments on the tray rattled.
They looked at Jarren’s outstretched hand as if he were reaching for a weapon. They looked like two people who had inadvertently stumbled upon a sleeping lion and were terrified that any sudden movement would wake it. They were acting as if they would suffer the Wrath of God if they did anything to displease him.
Jarren stopped, his hand hovering over the remote. He looked at them, then at us, his face a mask of pure, unadulterated confusion. He had no memory of the thrown glass, no recollection of the feral, snarling man he had become. He only saw his doctor and nurse staring at him as if he were about to explode.
“What?” Jarren asked, his voice raspy. “Is… is something wrong?”
The tension in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Then, from the corner of the room, came a low, rumbling chuckle.
It was Triston Casas. He had been dozing in his chair and had woken up to the strange standoff. He looked at the terrified medical staff, then at Jarren’s bewildered face, and he couldn’t hold it in. The chuckle grew into a full, deep laugh, the first genuine laugh any of us had heard in what felt like a lifetime.
“Oh, man,” Triston said, wiping a tear of mirth from his eye. “You should have seen yourself yesterday, JD. They think you’re gonna go all Hulk on them.”
Cora cracked a weary smile, the tension breaking. “Mijo, let’s just say you weren’t exactly a cooperative patient yesterday. The doctor here almost had to get a new haircut, courtesy of that water glass.”
Jarren’s eyes widened in horror as a vague, blurry memory of anger and shattering glass surfaced. “I… I threw a glass at him?”
“With extreme prejudice,” I added, a dry, tired smile touching my own lips for the first time. “I was about to call up a lefty from Pawtucket with that kind of arm. Your aim was impeccable.”
The absurdity of it, the sheer, ridiculous contrast between the terrified man of yesterday and the weak, confused man in the bed today, was too much. The shared trauma, the exhaustion, the profound relief of seeing him lucid—it all coalesced into a wave of cathartic humor.
Cora started laughing, a deep, rolling laugh of a man who had been to the edge and back. I found myself chuckling, a sound that felt foreign and wonderful.
Jarren looked at the three of us, laughing, and his confusion slowly melted away, replaced by a sheepish, embarrassed grin. He sank back into his pillow, covering his face with his good hand.
“Oh, no,” he groaned, though the sound was muffled by his own laughter. “No way.”
Dr. Collins and the nurse watched us, their expressions shifting from terror to bewilderment, and finally, to a shared, relieved smile. The lion was not only asleep; it was laughing at itself. The danger had passed.
“It’s okay, Doctor,” Cora said, waving him forward. “He’s back with us. I promise he won’t bite.”
As Dr. Collins cautiously approached the bed to begin his examination, the room was filled with the sound of our laughter. It was a strange, beautiful, and utterly necessary sound. It was the sound of healing. It was the sound of the morning after the storm, when the sun finally breaks through the clouds, and you find that you can, against all odds, still find joy in the wreckage.
<More Jokes as the doctors check on Jarren><Jarren asked for some water, Craig reached for it before realizing what had happened to the glass pitcher><add more details. Write as long as you need>
The laughter, fragile as it was, lingered in the air, fundamentally changing the atmosphere of the room. The sterile, tense space of the previous day had been transformed into something resembling a normal locker room, filled with the gentle ribbing and shared camaraderie of teammates.
Dr. Collins, now confident he wasn’t about to have a medical instrument hurled at him, began his examination. He worked with a gentle touch, unwrapping the outer layers of the bandage to inspect for any signs of renewed swelling or seepage.
“Alright, Jarren,” the doctor said, his tone now light and conversational. “On a scale of one to ten, with ten being… well, let’s just say yesterday… what’s the pain level right now?”
Jarren managed a weak smile. “Maybe a three? A two? It just aches.”
Triston, from his chair, snorted. “A two? Bro, I saw your face yesterday. You were at, like, a fifteen. We’re gonna have to recalibrate the whole pain scale for you. The ‘Duran Scale.’ Zero is comfortable, and ten is silver nitrate.”
Jarren groaned and threw a pillow at him, which Triston caught easily. “Shut up, Casas.”
“No, seriously,” Triston continued, leaning forward with a mock-serious expression. “We should patent it. ‘How you feeling today?’ ‘Eh, about a 4-Duran.’ ‘Oof, that’s rough.’ See? It works.”
Even Cora was chuckling. “Don’t give him any ideas, Triston. His agent will want a percentage.” He looked at Jarren. “But he’s right, mijo. After yesterday, I don’t think you’re allowed to complain about a paper cut ever again.”
As the doctor finished his inspection, satisfied that the inflammation was beginning to subside, Jarren’s voice came out, raspy and dry. “Hey… can I get some water?”
“Of course,” I said immediately, my paternal, GM instincts kicking in. I turned to the bedside table to grab the water pitcher that had been there the night before. My hand reached for it, and then froze in mid-air as my brain caught up with my actions.
The table was empty, except for the remote and Jarren’s phone. There was no pitcher. There was no glass.
My eyes darted to the corner of the room, where a janitor had meticulously swept up the glittering shards hours ago.
The memory of the glass whistling past the doctor’s ear, of it exploding against the wall, flashed in my mind. I pulled my hand back as if the table were hot.
The room fell silent for a beat as everyone realized what had just happened.
Jarren looked at my retracted hand, then at the empty table, and a slow, horrified realization dawned on his face. “Oh, man,” he whispered. “The glass… That was the water glass, wasn’t it?”
Triston burst out laughing again, unable to help himself. “Dude, you didn’t just throw it. You vaporized it. It was like a big-league fastball hitting a wall. There was nothing left.”
Cora shook his head, a grin spreading across his face. “We were going to give you the bill, but Craig decided to write it off as a necessary clubhouse expense.”
I managed a wry smile, though the memory still sent a chill down my spine. “Let’s just say we’re switching to plastic cups in here for a while. For ‘safety reasons.’” I looked around the room. “I’ll go get you a bottle from the clubhouse.”
As I walked out the door, the sound of Triston’s booming laughter and Jarren’s weak but genuine chuckles followed me down the hall. It was a good sound. It was the sound of a man being welcomed back among the living, not with hushed whispers and pity, but with the familiar, healing language of baseball players: a relentless, affectionate, and deeply respectful stream of crap. The fever was gone. The terror was gone. And for the first time, the ghosts of the park seemed to have, at least for a little while, gone quiet.
<doctors suggested food and drink><Jarren had no stomach for that after the fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details. Write as long as you need>
I returned with a bottle of water, and Jarren drank it down gratefully, the simple act of swallowing still a conscious effort. Dr. Collins, after finishing his assessment and redressing the wound with a lighter, more breathable bandage, gave his final instructions.
“The fever’s broken, which is an excellent sign,” he said, his tone now back to its familiar clinical calm. “The antibiotics are working. But his body has been through a significant trauma. He’s severely dehydrated and his system is depleted. He needs calories and electrolytes, now.” He looked pointedly at Jarren. “Food and drink. As much as you can tolerate. It’s not a suggestion, it’s part of the prescription.”
Jarren, who had been feeling a fragile sense of normalcy return, paled at the thought. The aftermath of a high fever had left his stomach in a state of churning, uneasy rebellion. The idea of putting anything in it felt like an impossible task.
“I… I don’t think I can, Doc,” he said, his voice weak. “I’m not hungry. At all.”
“You’re not supposed to be hungry,” the doctor replied patiently. “You’re supposed to be healing. Your body needs fuel to do that. Broth, juice, a protein shake, crackers. Something. Anything.”
With that, the medical staff departed, leaving the three of us with our final, and surprisingly difficult, task: convincing a man with no appetite to eat.
“Alright, you heard the man,” Cora said, immediately shifting into his no-nonsense manager mode. “What do you want? I’ll have the clubhouse guys bring anything.”
Jarren just shook his head, a look of mild nausea on his face. “Nothing, Alex. Please. Maybe later.”
“Nope. Not happening,” Cora said, pulling out his phone. “We’re not doing ‘later.’ We’re doing ‘now.’” He looked at Jarren, his eyes narrowing in a way that was both stern and deeply caring. “You’re going to tell me something, or I’m going to have them bring you the blandest chicken broth and rice you’ve ever tasted, and I’m going to sit here and watch you eat every last spoonful. Your choice.”
It was the classic parental gambit, and it was brutally effective. Jarren knew that look. It was the same look Cora got in the dugout when a player wasn’t running out a ground ball. It was non-negotiable.
Jarren sighed, a gesture of weary defeat. “Fine,” he mumbled. “A Gatorade? The light blue one?”
“Better,” Cora said, already texting. “And something solid.”
“I don’t know… maybe some saltines?” Jarren offered weakly.
“Saltines and a Gatorade. We can work with that,” Cora said, finishing his text. “It’s on its way.”
A few minutes later, a clubhouse attendant appeared with a tray bearing a blue Gatorade and a sleeve of saltine crackers. He placed it on the bedside table with a quiet, respectful nod and quickly departed.
Jarren stared at the tray as if it were another medical instrument. He drank some of the Gatorade, but just looked at the crackers with a distinct lack of enthusiasm.
Cora watched him for a minute, his patience wearing thin. He sighed, pulled his chair closer, and picked up the sleeve of crackers. He tore it open, took one out, and held it out to Jarren.
“Come on,” he said, his voice softening again, the stern manager replaced by the concerned father. “Just one. For me.”
Jarren looked at the cracker, then at Cora’s insistent, unwavering face. He knew he wasn’t going to win this battle. With a long-suffering sigh, he took the cracker and nibbled at the corner, chewing slowly, deliberately.
Cora watched him, his expression unreadable. He waited until Jarren had finished the first one, then held out another.
“Good. Now another one.”
And so it went. For the next fifteen minutes, Alex Cora, the manager of the Boston Red Sox, sat by his player’s bedside and patiently, stubbornly, hand-fed him saltine crackers one by one, making sure he drank the Gatorade between bites. Triston and I watched in a shared, respectful silence.
It was a small, almost comical scene, but it was imbued with a profound significance. It was the ultimate act of care. It was a demonstration that his well-being was so important that his manager would personally take on the mundane, frustrating task of making him eat when he didn’t want to.
Jarren managed to get through half the sleeve before he finally shook his head, a look of genuine queasiness on his face. “Okay, Alex. That’s it. I can’t do any more.”
Cora looked at the remaining crackers, then at Jarren’s pale face. He had pushed him as far as he could for now. He nodded, satisfied.
“Alright,” he said, putting the sleeve down. “For now. But in an hour, we’re going for the other half.”
Jarren groaned, but there was no real protest in it. He understood. This, too, was part of the healing. This, too, was how they were going to hold him together. Not just through the fire, but through the slow, tedious, and necessary process of recovery that came after.
<Cora forced everything down><Jarren Felt much better><He went to the dugout to watch the game in the afternoon><Teammates joked with him all the time><For the first time, he realized his teammates loved him just the same even if he was not contributing><add more details. Write as long as you need.>
True to his word, an hour later, Cora was back with the rest of the crackers. And after that, a cup of lukewarm chicken broth. He cajoled, he commanded, he guilt-tripped, and he refused to take no for an answer. By early afternoon, through a sheer force of managerial will, Jarren had consumed the entire sleeve of crackers, the cup of broth, and two full bottles of Gatorade.
And, miraculously, he started to feel better. The calories and electrolytes began to do their work, chasing away the worst of the dizzying weakness and nausea. A hint of his natural color returned to his cheeks. The profound, bone-deep exhaustion began to recede, replaced by a more normal, manageable tiredness.
He was still weak, still sore, but he was no longer fragile. He was on the mend.
“Okay, I’ve had enough of this room,” he announced around 3 p.m., swinging his legs carefully off the side of the cot. “I want to watch the game.”
Before I or Cora could protest, he held up his good hand. “Not on TV. With the guys. I’m going to the dugout.”
We exchanged a look. It was probably against a dozen medical protocols, but we also knew that for him, being with his team was a different kind of medicine, and perhaps just as vital.
“Alright,” I said. “But you are sitting on the bench. You are not moving. You are not doing anything but watching. Triston, you’re his bodyguard. Don’t let him do anything stupid.”
“Got it, boss,” Casas said with a grin, happy to have a new, official role.
The journey from the trainer’s room to the dugout was a small parade. I walked in front, clearing a path. Triston walked beside Jarren, a hand hovering near his back, ready to steady him. Cora brought up the rear. When we emerged into the dugout during a pitching change, the effect was immediate.
A cheer went up from the players on the bench. Not a loud, stadium-wide cheer, but a personal, heartfelt one.
“Look what the cat dragged in!” Kenley Jansen yelled from the far end.
“Hey, careful, he might throw something at you!” Pivetta shouted, and the whole bench erupted in laughter.
Jarren, his face flushing, managed a weak smile and gave them a one-fingered salute with his good hand.
They found him a spot at the end of the bench, right next to the bat rack, and Triston took up his post beside him. And for the next three hours, Jarren Duran did something he hadn’t done in a long time: he just watched a baseball game.
He wasn’t playing. He wasn’t producing. He wasn’t contributing a single thing to the team’s effort on the field. And yet, he had never felt more a part of it.
Throughout the game, a steady stream of teammates came by. Devers slapped him gently on the shoulder and asked him if the hospital food was as bad as they say. Trevor Story came over to complain about the umpire’s strike zone, a normal, everyday conversation that felt wonderfully, blessedly mundane. Even the starting pitcher from that day, once he was out of the game, came and sat with him, going over pitches, treating him like the valued teammate whose opinion he respected.
They joked with him relentlessly about his new “superpower” of frightening doctors. They asked him if his bandaged hand gave him a better grip for holding a clipboard. They didn’t treat him with pity. They didn’t walk on eggshells around him. They treated him like one of them. They treated him like Jarren.
And as he sat there, surrounded by the easy camaraderie, the inside jokes, and the unconditional acceptance of his teammates, a profound and revolutionary thought began to dawn on him.
They weren’t just being nice to him because he was a good player. They weren’t just tolerating him until he could get back on the field and help them win. They actually… liked him. They valued his presence, even when he was providing no material value. Their affection wasn’t conditional on his performance.
He looked at his bandaged hand, the symbol of his deepest pain and failure. And he looked at the men around him, laughing and joking and treating him as if nothing had changed, and everything had changed.
For the first time in his life, he began to suspect that the love he had been fighting so desperately to earn had been there all along, freely given. He wasn’t just an asset to be utilized. He was a brother. He was home. And in the warm afternoon sun of Fenway Park, surrounded by his team, he felt a sense of peace that no personal accolade, no MVP award, no heroic home run had ever been able to provide. He was not contributing. And he was still enough.
