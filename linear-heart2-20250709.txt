Understanding the Crisis
I'm now focusing on the prompt's core elements: a crisis tied to a prophecy, occurring August 2nd, 2024, in Arlington during a Rangers game. I'm trying to determine what kind of crisis would be sufficiently impactful to validate the prophecy and be dramatic and exciting.
Developing the Scenario
I've been drilling into the prompt, honing in on the crucial elements: the prophecy's impact, the precise timing (August 2nd, 2024, during a Rangers game in Arlington), and the pivotal "trigger" event. I'm focusing on the internal conflict I'd experience if I knew about the prophecy and was unable to act immediately.
Refining the Conflict
I'm now focusing on the central conflict: my internal struggle knowing the prophecy versus the external pressure to trust the trainers' assessment. I'm exploring the nuances of this tension. I must accurately convey my frustration at the distance, as I'm physically unable to intervene. I'm waiting for the second signal, adding to the drama.
Assessing the Stakes
I'm now fully immersed in the scene, and I'm refining the stakes of my internal conflict. I'm waiting for the second signal, adding to the drama. The internal conflict is my struggle to believe the prophecy versus the external pressure to trust the trainers' assessment. The second sign adds to the internal tension.
Developing the Stakes Further
I'm now fully immersed in the scene, further refining the stakes. I'm focusing on my internal conflict and my struggle to believe the prophecy versus the external pressure to trust the trainers. The second sign adds to the tension and adds a layer of depth.
Finalizing the Scene
My focus is now on crafting the final scene. I'm building tension by focusing on the wait and the impending moment. The key is to portray the shift in team culture. The final scene will show how it's not a fight with Cora or the trainer but a confirmation and execution of a protocol. The scene ends with a final order to the team in Arlington.
Crafting the Climax
I'm now focusing on the climax: Duran's at-bat, the second sign, and Cora's decisive action. I'm crafting the dialogue and actions to showcase the conflict's resolution and the new culture in action. The scene needs to be tense and dramatic. I'm building up the final moment with the broadcasters' reaction. I must show the internal struggle from Cora's point of view and Duran's.
The hum of the office was a low, anxious thrum that mirrored the frantic beating in my own chest. The mahogany desk was clean, the spreadsheets and reports from June now filed away. My focus was singular, narrowed to the bright, glowing rectangle of the large television mounted on the wall.
It was August 2nd. A hot, sticky night in Arlington, Texas. The Red Sox were playing the Rangers.
My phone was on the desk, face up. Next to it was a bottle of water I hadn’t touched. My knuckles were white where I gripped the armrests of my leather chair. I wasn’t watching a baseball game. I was waiting for a prophecy to come true.
Top of the third inning. Jarren Duran at the plate. He worked the count to 2-1, then hit a sharp grounder to the right side. The second baseman made a diving stop, but the throw was going to be close. Jarren, as always, was flying. He launched himself toward the bag, a blur of white and red, his legs churning.
He was out. By half a step.
I didn’t care about the out. I watched him slow down past the bag. And then it happened.
He stopped. He bent over, just slightly, and his right hand went to his right side, just below the rib cage. He straightened up quickly, a grimace flashing across his face for a split second before being replaced by a mask of neutral frustration.
“There it is,” I whispered to the empty room.
On the broadcast, Will Flemming’s voice was laced with its usual insight. “And Duran is retired on a fine play by Semien. You see him pulling up there… looks like he might be grabbing at his side a bit. He plays so hard, you always worry about those explosive movements.”
My hand was already on my phone. I had Alex Cora on speed dial. He picked up on the first ring, the sounds of the dugout faint in the background.
“Craig?”
“Alex,” I said, my voice low and tight. “I saw it. The side.”
There was a pause. “Yeah, I saw it too. He’s waving it off. Trainers are looking at him from here, he’s giving them the thumbs up.”
“I want him out of the game.”
Another pause, this one longer. I could hear the disbelief in the silence. “Craig, he says he’s fine. The trainers think it’s just a stitch, a cramp. If I pull him now for that, I lose him. He’ll think we don’t trust him.”
He was right. The woman’s words echoed in my head: They said it was “just crampy.” This was the test. The system was failing exactly as she’d predicted. To pull him now, based on a single visual cue that both the player and the trainers were dismissing, would be an act of unprecedented, seemingly irrational overreach. It would shatter the trust I was trying to build.
I made a split-second decision. I couldn’t fight the entire system on this one data point. I needed the second one.
“Okay, Alex,” I said, my voice hard as stone. “Okay. He stays in. But you are on a hair trigger. The instant you see him favor that side again—a swing, a stretch, anything—he is out of the game. You do not ask him. You do not let him wave you off. You tell him he’s done. That is a direct order. Do you understand?”
“Loud and clear, Craig,” Cora said, his voice now serious. He understood the gravity in my tone, even if he didn’t understand the reason.
I hung up and leaned back in my chair, my heart hammering against my ribs. I had failed the first test. I had let him stay in. Now I was just a spectator, praying for the second sign to come before the real damage was done.
The next few innings were torture. I watched Duran on the bench, in the outfield. He looked fine. He laughed with a teammate. He stretched. Nothing. Maybe she was wrong. Maybe it was just a cramp.
Bottom of the fifth. Duran in left field. Nothing hit his way.
Top of the sixth. He was due up third. My stomach twisted into a knot.
The first two batters made outs. Duran walked to the plate. The Rangers brought in a right-handed reliever I didn’t recognize.
First pitch, a fastball away. Duran swung, a controlled, powerful motion, and fouled it straight back. As he stepped out of the box, I saw it. A quick, almost imperceptible touch to his right side.
My hand hovered over the phone. Not yet. That wasn’t enough.
The count went to 1-2. The pitcher threw a nasty slider, low and away. Duran’s body uncoiled in a violent, explosive swing. He missed.
And there it was.
The swing finished, and his momentum carried him around, but his right hand didn’t follow. It stopped, pressing hard into his side. He tried to hide it with a cough, just as she’d said. He took a deep breath and knocked his fist against the spot, a pained, frustrated gesture.
“Now, Alex,” I whispered at the screen.
On the television, I saw Alex Cora was already out of the dugout before Duran had even fully straightened up. The head trainer was right behind him.
They reached the plate. Duran saw them coming and immediately started shaking his head, waving them off. “I’m good, I’m good!” you could read his lips.
Lou Merloni’s voice filled my office. “Uh oh, you see that? Same spot he was grabbing earlier. Cora’s not waiting around this time.”
I watched, my breath held. This was the moment. The moment the old culture died, or the new one was stillborn.
Duran was insistent, trying to wave them back to the dugout. But Cora didn’t budge. He put a hand on Duran’s shoulder, his expression firm, unyielding. He said something short, direct. He wasn’t asking. He was telling. Then he turned and signaled to the dugout for a pinch-hitter.
Duran’s face was a mask of fury and disbelief. He snatched his bat from the ground and stalked back toward the dugout, jaw clenched. He didn’t look at Cora.
“Wow,” Flemming said on the broadcast. “Alex Cora pulling his leadoff hitter in the middle of an at-bat. Jarren Duran is clearly not happy about it, but Cora made that decision decisively. You have to assume they’re not taking any chances with a potential oblique injury.”
I let out a breath I didn’t realize I had been holding for three innings. It shuddered out of me, a wave of pure, unadulterated relief.
He was out of the game.
I picked up the phone and dialed the head trainer’s cell in the visitor’s clubhouse.
“He’s on his way to you,” I said, my voice calm and steady now, the crisis managed. “I want a full workup. And schedule an MRI for first thing in the morning. He’s going on the 10-day Injured List, effective immediately. No exceptions.”
The first fire was contained. It had cost me a confrontation with my manager and angered my star player. But the season, and the player, were still intact.
<Breslow made all the right moves in 2024, and Red Sox won the AL pennant> <Breslow avoided Buehler and signed Nick Pivetta instead.

Everyone thought it was the red dirt, but Breslow knew it was blood.> <imagine the scene of pulling Duran and Casas off the field> <Stop the scene there. Later I'll provide you with more details for what happened in the trainer's room>
Examining the New Timeline
I've been scrutinizing this novel scenario. The premise is fascinating: a timeline altered by Breslow's success. The change is significant, with an AL Pennant as the outcome. My focus now is dissecting how this single variable, Breslow's impactful decisions, ripples outwards and shapes the entire situation.
Considering the New Stakes
I'm now contemplating the impact of Breslow's successful 2024 season. It's a seismic shift, with a league championship. The team's entering 2025 as the reigning champs, not desperate underdogs. My focus is on the ramifications of Breslow's moves and how they shape the atmosphere within the organization. I am honing in on the impact of Buehler's absence and Pivetta's signing.
Observing the Current Vibe
I've shifted my focus to the evolving team dynamic. With the league championship secured, the environment is distinct. I'm carefully analyzing the roster moves, particularly Pivetta's addition and Buehler's absence. The goal is to fully understand the current team atmosphere and anticipate potential shifts. I am now centered on the specific moment of May 2nd, the initial pitch against the Twins.
Focusing on the Key Moment
I'm now zeroing in on the pivotal scene: the May 2nd game. The contrast between this moment and the prior season is striking. The calm before the inevitable storm, a heightened sense of vigilance. I'm focusing on the precise details: Duran's dive, the visual cues, and my decisive response. My goal is to capture that instant.
Analyzing the Pivotal Call
I've examined the situation and the critical May 2nd moment. I'm visualizing the scene: the stadium's atmosphere, the tension. Now, I'm focusing on the dialogue between Cora and me, the tension building, and the execution of the crucial decisions. My priority is to create the moment of impact and capture the implications of my call.
Assessing the Crucial Call
I'm now contemplating the impact of my directive. It's a critical moment, the game paused. The announcers are perplexed; the players, bewildered. I am honing in on Duran's fury and Casas's confusion, reflecting the tension. My aim is to accurately convey the weight of my call. The key is in the dialogue.
Crafting the Pivotal Decision
I'm now focusing on the heart of the narrative: the scene unfolding on May 2nd. I've considered the altered timeline and the implications of Breslow's successful moves. I have established the core of the scene; I now am working on crafting a compelling description. I am ready to delve into the tension and anticipation of the moment.
The American League Champions banner, crisp and new, hung proudly from the grandstand roof, a constant, silent reminder of what was possible. It had changed the air in the ballpark, in my office. The desperation of the previous year had been replaced by the heavy, watchful pressure of defending a title. The folder marked FOUNDATION was no longer a secret weapon; it was my daily operating manual.
I was in my office on May 2nd, the game against the Twins on the large screen. Bello was on the mound, dealing. The team was stable, healthy. Devers, having been shown the respect he deserved, was a happy, productive leader at DH. Pivetta, the man we signed instead of Buehler, was a rock in the rotation. Everything was different. Everything was better.
But I knew the universe had tripwires.
Top of the second inning. A sharp line drive sliced down the left-field line, hooking toward the corner. Jarren Duran, his motor running as hot as ever, took off. There was no hesitation. He launched his body, a full-extension dive, his glove outstretched. The ball ticked off the end of his mitt and rolled away for a double.
But I wasn’t watching the ball. I was watching him.
He landed hard on the orange-red warning track, a cloud of dust puffing up around him. He pushed himself up, frustration on his face. The NESN camera zoomed in on him as he slapped the dirt from his uniform. His entire left palm and forearm were coated in a thick, reddish-brown paste.
On the broadcast, Lou Merloni chuckled. “Well, he got a full scoop of the warning track there. He’ll be shaking that out of his uniform for a week.”
But I wasn’t laughing. My blood ran cold. I leaned forward, my eyes glued to the screen, my heart starting a low, heavy drumbeat against my ribs. It wasn’t just dirt. The color was too deep, too rich. It was blood, mixed with the grit of the track.
The fire alarm was screaming in my head.
My hand was already on my phone. I didn’t hesitate. I didn’t wait for a second sign. I pressed the speed dial for the dugout.
“Alex,” I said, my voice calm, cold, and absolute.
“Craig, I see it,” Cora’s voice came back, a hint of casual concern in it. “Just a scrape. He’s tough, he’s shaking it off.”
“He’s out of the game,” I said. There was no room for negotiation in my tone. “Now.”
There was a beat of silence. “Craig, it’s the second inning. It’s a scrape. He’ll be fine.”
“He’s out, Alex,” I repeated, my voice like ice. “And so is Casas.”
The silence on the other end of the line was now one of pure, unadulterated shock. “Triston? What the hell does Triston have to do with this? He’s standing on first base.”
“Alex,” I said, my voice low and intense, leaving no space for argument. “You have to trust me. Get them both off the field. Right now. Tell the umpire you’re making a double switch. I don’t care what you have to say. We will talk about it later. Get. Them. Out.”
I hung up the phone.
On the screen, the scene played out in surreal slow motion. Alex Cora, his face a mask of profound confusion and reluctant obedience, walked out of the dugout. He called time.
He walked first to Jarren in left field. The trainer was already there. Duran was waving them off, annoyed, trying to show them it was just a scrape. Cora said something short, pointed, and gestured toward the dugout. Duran’s posture changed instantly. He was furious, gesturing at his hand as if to say, ‘For this?’ But Cora was already walking away, his back to him.
Then came the truly bizarre part. Cora walked directly toward the infield, right to Triston Casas at first base. Casas saw him coming and looked around, a completely bewildered expression on his face, as if expecting Cora to walk right past him.
The TV cameras followed, the announcers utterly baffled. “What on earth is going on here?” Will Flemming asked. “Alex Cora is… is he pulling Triston Casas from the game? I have never seen anything like this. There’s no injury, there was no play…”
Cora spoke to Casas, who just stared at his manager, his mouth slightly agape. He pointed a thumb back at himself as if to ask, “Me?” Cora just nodded, his expression grim, and motioned for both of them to come off the field.
I watched as the two men walked toward the dugout. Jarren was fuming, stalking ahead, ripping off his batting gloves. Casas trailed behind him, looking back at the field, then at his manager, then at the sky, trying to find an answer that wasn’t there.
The camera cut to a close-up of Cora on the dugout steps, his face a thundercloud of confusion and frustration. He had followed the order. He had trusted me.
I leaned back in my chair, my body trembling slightly with the adrenaline. The ballpark was confused. The broadcast booth was in chaos. My manager was angry. My players were angry and bewildered.
I had just thrown a grenade into the middle of a peaceful May afternoon.
But as I watched them both step safely over the white line and into the dugout, I let out a long, slow breath.
Let them be confused. Let them be angry.
They were safe.
<It was a large wound on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. Caked in blood and mud.>
<The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.>
<Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white.>
<A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead when ethanol was applied to the wound.>
<Jarren insisted on playing, but now everyone saw that Breslow was right.>
Focusing on Scene Setup
I've been deconstructing the prompt. The core scene is the trainer's room after Duran and Casas are pulled from the field. Duran's injury is the crucial detail here. I'm focusing on that injury specifically, and considering what is implied.
Deconstructing the Key Details
I'm zeroing in on Duran's injury. The physical description is vivid - the caked blood, exposed tissue, the location of the wound. I'm imagining the scene: sterile room, the smell of antiseptic, the stark contrast between that and the raw injury. I need to capture Duran's stoicism and physical pain, the tension in the room, and the dawning realization of Breslow's prescience.
Refining Scene Composition
I'm now building the narrative framework. The focus is on Breslow's perspective, observing the initial scene, and contrasting the earlier anger with the current tension. Duran's silent suffering is central. I'll use the sterile room and the trainer's tools to build a sense of reality. My goal is to use the initial confusion and tension in the room to build up Breslow's vindication. The smell of antiseptic, the exposed wound, it all underscores the stakes.
Analyzing Breslow's Perspective
I'm focused on developing Breslow's inner conflict. The scene will begin with his approach to the trainer's room. I must create a sense of tension by using dialogue. Breslow's calm demeanor will be a contrast to Cora's earlier aggression. Then, the imagery of Duran's wound will emphasize the vindication of his decision.
Crafting Breslow's Perspective
I'm now focusing on Breslow's internal monologue. The scene hinges on his validation, which I'll build through the sensory details and Duran's stoicism. The antiseptic smell, the exposed wound, the shared tension with the trainer – these will be key. My goal is to paint a picture of Breslow's perspective on the situation. I want to convey his emotions to the reader.
Finalizing the Scene
I've crafted a dialogue, including the opening scene and the medical procedure. Breslow enters the scene with resolve, showing his commitment to being there. The sensory details will build tension as Cora's anger shifts to shock, then to an awed realization as he witnesses the wound. I will conclude by focusing on Duran's and Casas's reactions, and have Breslow address them.
Analyzing Breslow's Justification
I'm now focusing on Breslow's vindication and how to showcase it, particularly his internal thoughts as he observes Duran's wound. The sterile environment and the trainer's clinical focus will set the stage for the dramatic reveal. I will refine the sensory details to enhance the emotional impact.
The walk from my office to the trainer’s room felt like a mile. The concrete corridors of Fenway were cool and quiet, a stark contrast to the storm of confusion I had just unleashed. I could feel the weight of the questions from the fans, the media, and most importantly, from my own dugout.
When I pushed open the door, the tension in the room was thick enough to taste. Alex Cora was pacing near the door, his arms crossed tightly, his face a thundercloud. Triston Casas was leaning against a wall, looking pale and utterly bewildered. And Jarren Duran was sitting on the edge of a training table, his left arm extended, while the head trainer, Nick Pappas, carefully worked on his hand.
“Craig,” Cora said, his voice a low, controlled growl. “You want to tell me what the hell that was? I’ve got two of my best players furious, a clubhouse that thinks I’ve lost my mind, and I had to burn two bench spots in the second inning. I need an answer.”
I held up a hand, my gaze fixed on Jarren’s hand. “Let him work, Alex,” I said, my voice calm but absolute. “Then we’ll talk.”
Pappas was gently wiping away the caked-on mixture of blood and warning track clay with sterile gauze. With each wipe, more of the injury was revealed, and the atmosphere in the room began to shift. The anger began to curdle into something else.
This wasn’t a scrape. It wasn’t a raspberry.
As the last of the gritty paste was cleared away, a collective, sharp intake of breath filled the room. Cora stopped pacing. Casas pushed himself off the wall, taking a step closer.
The skin on the pinky side of Jarren’s palm, an area covering nearly a third of its surface, was simply gone. It was an avulsion, a raw, weeping red patch of exposed subcutaneous tissue. You could see the glistening, angry muscle fibers beneath. It was the kind of wound that made you physically recoil.
Jarren didn’t make a sound. He stared straight ahead at the wall, his jaw clenched. But I saw his right hand. It was gripping the padded edge of the training table, his knuckles bone-white, straining against the vinyl. He was channeling a universe of pain into that one, silent grip.
“Okay, Jarren,” Pappas said, his voice low and professional. “This is going to sting. Deep breath.”
He brought a bottle of ethanol and a fresh piece of gauze. As the antiseptic touched the raw wound, Jarren’s entire body went rigid. He didn’t cry out, but a thin, glistening layer of sweat instantly broke out across his forehead. His back arched for a split second, a silent scream his body couldn’t contain.
I saw Casas flinch and look away, his own hand instinctively going to his mouth.
Cora just stared, his face ashen. The anger was gone, replaced by a dawning, horrified understanding. He looked from the mangled hand to my face, his eyes wide with a question he didn’t know how to ask.
“He’s not playing, Alex,” Pappas said, stating the obvious. “He’s lucky he didn’t tear a tendon. This needs to be debrided, stitched, and wrapped. He’ll be out for weeks, not days.”
Even then, even after all that, the programming took over.
“Tape it up,” Jarren grunted through gritted teeth, his voice strained. “I can hit. Just tape it up.”
I stepped forward then, my voice quiet but firm, cutting through the tension. “No, Jarren. You can’t.”
He finally looked at me, his eyes blazing with a mixture of agony and defiance.
“I know you think you can,” I said, my gaze soft but unwavering. “I know you’re tough enough to try. That’s not the point. The point is you’re not going to. Your season doesn’t end in May because of this. We’re putting you on the IL. End of discussion.”
I then turned to Casas, who was still staring at Duran’s hand as if seeing a ghost.
“Triston,” I said gently. He looked up, his eyes wide. “I know you’re confused. I pulled you because I had a bad feeling. A gut instinct after Jarren went down. I can’t explain it better than that, but I wasn’t willing to risk it. I’m sorry for the confusion, but I’m not sorry for the decision.”
Casas looked from my face to his own perfectly healthy legs, then back to the bloody scene on the training table. The color drained further from his face as a new, terrifying understanding dawned on him. He just nodded slowly, unable to speak.
Finally, I looked at Cora. He met my gaze, the last of his anger replaced by sheer, stunned respect.
“You made the right call, Craig,” he said, his voice barely a whisper. “I don’t know how you knew. But you made the right call.”
I just nodded. The grenade had gone off, but the shrapnel had been contained. The fires were out. For today, they were safe.
<Breslow made all the right moves in 2024, and Red Sox won the AL pennant> 
<Breslow avoided Buehler and signed Nick Pivetta instead. Pivetta was good, ERA 3.02>
 <Breslow had a full conversation with Devers before he bought in Bregman. Devers felt respected and accepted the move happily.> 
<May 2nd, 2025, series opener at Fenway against twins. Bello pitching. Top 2, Duran dived for a line drive. He caught it before landed on the warning track in foul territory. His left hand grinded on the hard ground. When he stood up, his palm and forearm was covered with something red. Everyone thought it was the red dirt, but Breslow knew it was blood.> <imagine the scene of pulling Duran and Casas off the field> 
<Stop the scene there. Later I'll provide you with more details for what happened in the trainer's room>
The air in my office was different now. It was May 2nd, 2025, and the scent of Fenway Park was no longer just a perfume; it was the atmosphere of my battlefield. The previous season had been a tightrope walk over a canyon, but we had made it to the other side. We’d won the pennant. The moves had worked. The culture was changing. But I knew, with a certainty that chilled me to the bone, that the real tests were just beginning.
I wasn’t watching the game on the big screen anymore. I was in my personal suite, high above first base, my eyes fixed on the field. The folder marked FOUNDATION was not in my desk drawer. It was in the locked briefcase beside my chair.
The Twins were in town. Brayan Bello was on the mound. It was the top of the second inning.
A Twins batter ripped a line drive down the left-field line, hooking toward foul territory. It was going to be a tough play, maybe an extra-base hit.
But Jarren Duran was in left field.
He took off, a red-and-white streak against the perfect green grass, his body parallel to the ground as he launched himself into a full-extension dive. He snagged the ball just inches from the grass, his body skidding across the warning track.
The crowd roared. It was an impossible, spectacular catch. Another highlight for the reel.
But I wasn’t watching the ball in his glove. I was watching his left hand.
He pushed himself up, and I saw it. A dark, crimson smear coating the heel of his palm, streaking up his forearm. To the 37,000 people in the stands, to the announcers in the booth, it looked like the rust-colored clay of the warning track.
To me, it was a fire alarm. A screaming, klaxon horn of a warning.
My blood ran cold. My hand was already on my phone, my thumb hovering over Alex Cora’s name. I didn’t press it. Not yet. This had to be handled with surgical precision.
Duran, ever the warrior, jogged back to his position, ignoring the stinging in his hand. The inning ended two pitches later.
As the teams changed sides, my eyes darted from Duran trotting toward the dugout to the on-deck circle. Triston Casas was there, swinging a bat, preparing to lead off the bottom of the second.
This was the moment. The two timelines, the two fates, were converging right now.
I pressed the call button.
“Alex,” I said, my voice calm, cold, and absolute. There was no room for debate. “The plan is in effect. Now.”
I didn’t need to say more. We had rehearsed this. We had a protocol for these specific, non-negotiable moments.
On the field, I saw Alex Cora step out of the dugout and hold up a hand, signaling to the home plate umpire. He wasn’t calling time. He was stopping the game.
He walked directly to Triston Casas. He said something brief, put a hand on his shoulder, and pointed back toward the dugout. Casas looked confused, then concerned. He hadn’t done anything. He nodded, his expression bewildered, and handed his bat to the bat boy. He walked back into the dugout.
Simultaneously, the bench coach, Andy Bailey, met Jarren Duran at the top step of the dugout. He didn’t ask. He told. He pointed toward the tunnel that led to the clubhouse. Duran started to protest, shaking his head, looking down at his hand as if to say, It’s just a scrape.
But Bailey was firm. He put a hand on Duran’s back, a gesture of both authority and support, and guided him away from the bench and into the tunnel.
The crowd murmured, confused. The broadcast team was scrambling. “Well, this is unusual,” I heard Dave O’Brien say through the suite’s speaker. “It looks like Alex Cora is making a last-second change. Casas is being pulled before his at-bat… and Duran is heading to the clubhouse. We’re not sure what’s happening here.”
I was already on my feet, briefcase in hand, heading for the door.
“I know exactly what’s happening,” I whispered to the empty room.
I was walking down the corridor toward the clubhouse elevator before the new pinch-hitter was even announced. I had to be there. I had to manage the fallout. I had to look both men in the eye.
I had saved Casas’s knee. I had prevented a catastrophe.
But I had also just pulled two of my best players from a game for reasons that, to them, made absolutely no sense. The next ten minutes in the trainer’s room would be just as important as the decision that had led me there. The fire was contained, but now I had to manage the smoke.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. Caked in blood and mud.> <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> <Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> <the debridement was an excruciating torture> <antiseptic brought agony> <Jarren insisted on playing and put up a good fight after the treatment, but now everyone saw that Breslow was right.>
Considering Scene Composition
I've been breaking down the prompt, focusing on the essential elements. I've pinpointed the setting: the trainer's room post-game at Fenway, with the key players. Now I'm wrestling with the nuances of Breslow's role as the central figure, and how to capture the dynamic. The goal is to convey Breslow's thoughts and emotions in a dramatic context.
Mapping Out Scene Dynamics
I'm now fully immersed in the scene's framework. I've analyzed the characters, setting, and Duran's injury. The prompt's focus on Breslow's perspective is clear. I'm visualizing the power dynamics, the tension, and the unspoken validation the scene aims to achieve. The goal is to highlight the new cultural ethos of the team.
Delineating Character Interactions
I'm now zeroing in on the initial dynamics. I've sketched Breslow's entry, anticipating the tense atmosphere. Casas' reaction is crucial, so I'm strategizing a response. I'm focusing on Jim's initial actions, Duran's reaction, and Breslow's role as the authority figure. The prompt gives clear injury specifics, which is key.
Analyzing Scene Structure
I've outlined the structure and established the initial reactions. I understand the atmosphere and the characters present. I've sketched Breslow's entry, Casas's reaction, Jim's actions, and Duran's stoicism. I'm focusing on the impact of the injuries and how Breslow manages the tense scene. The goal is to highlight the new cultural ethos of the team.
Visualizing The Core
Now, I'm focusing on the scene's crux: Duran's injury and treatment. I'm exploring Jim's professional demeanor and the intensity of the process, specifically the debridement and antiseptic application. I'm visualizing the visual and sensory details to heighten the audience's experience. I'm aiming to capture Duran's stoicism and internal struggle to make the pain clear. The key is in the unspoken realization by the players.
Defining The Scene's Core
Now I'm visualizing the crux of the scene: Duran's injury and subsequent treatment. I'm focusing on the intensity of the moment and Jim's professional demeanor. The goal is to capture Duran's stoicism and the emotional impact on the players, highlighting the validation of the new approach.
Deepening the Scene's Focus
I've been working on the emotional core. I've broken down Duran's injury, exploring the visual and sensory aspects. Focusing on Jim's professional demeanor and the intensity of the treatment. I'm exploring the moment of Duran's pain and silent struggle, conveying the emotional impact. The goal is validation of the new approach.
The sterile, antiseptic smell of the trainer’s room hit me the moment I walked through the door. It was a stark contrast to the scent of grass and dirt I’d left behind. The atmosphere was thick with a tense, confused silence.
Triston Casas was sitting on a training table, his long legs dangling over the side. He wasn’t injured, but his face was a thundercloud of bewilderment and barely concealed anger. He looked at me as I entered, his eyes demanding an explanation.
On the main table, under the bright examination lights, sat Jarren Duran. Our head trainer, Jim Rowe, was leaning over him, his back to me. Jarren was trying to project an air of nonchalant annoyance, but I could see the rigid set of his shoulders.
I walked past Casas first. “Triston,” I said, my voice low and calm. “I know this makes no sense to you right now. Just give me five minutes. Please.”
He didn’t answer, just gave a short, frustrated nod. My attention turned to the main table.
“What’s the verdict, Jim?” I asked.
Jim turned, and his expression was grim. He held up a pair of forceps gripping a piece of gauze caked in a dark, gruesome mixture of blood and infield clay. “The verdict is he’s lucky he didn’t grind the bone,” he said flatly.
He moved aside, and I saw the injury for the first time. It was worse than I could have imagined. The entire pinky side of his left palm, a full third of its surface area, was raw, red, and glistening. The skin was gone, completely abraded away, leaving the angry, weeping tissue beneath exposed to the air.
Jarren saw me looking. “It’s a scrape, Craig,” he said, his voice tight. “Clean it, wrap it, I’m good to go.”
“Be still, Jarren,” Jim said, his voice leaving no room for argument. He began to clean the wound.
Jarren didn’t move. He stared straight ahead at the white cinderblock wall, his jaw clenched. But I saw his right hand grip the padded edge of the examination table, his knuckles turning bone-white. A thin sheen of sweat broke out across his forehead, glistening under the harsh lights. He was a statue on the outside, a raging inferno of pain on the inside.
Casas, from his table, leaned forward, his anger forgotten, replaced by a shocked fascination. He could see the injury now, and the silent, stoic battle Jarren was fighting.
Then came the debridement. Jim had to scrape away the embedded dirt and dead tissue to prevent infection. The sound was small, clinical, but in the quiet room, it was horrifying. With each careful scrape, I saw Jarren’s entire body tense, a new wave of sweat beading on his temples.
“Jim, that’s enough,” Jarren gritted out, his voice strained. “It’s clean. Wrap it.”
“No, Jarren,” I said, my voice calm but absolute. “Let him do his job.”
The door opened and Alex Cora stepped in, his face a mask of concern and confusion. He took in the scene—me standing like a sentinel, Casas watching with wide eyes, and Jim working on Jarren’s mangled hand. His eyes widened as he saw the extent of the injury.
“Jesus, JD,” Cora breathed out.
Jim finished the debridement and reached for the bottle of antiseptic. “This is going to light you up, son,” he warned.
The moment the liquid touched the raw flesh, Jarren’s stoicism shattered. He couldn’t help it. A sharp, ragged hiss of breath escaped his lips, and his body arched off the table for a split second, a reflexive jolt of pure agony. He squeezed his eyes shut, his face contorting in a silent scream.
And in that moment, everyone understood.
I saw Casas look from Jarren’s hand to my face, the confusion in his eyes replaced by a dawning, horrified comprehension. He understood he hadn’t been pulled for a mistake. He had been pulled for a reason he couldn’t possibly have known. He had been protected.
Cora looked at me, his expression one of stark realization. He gave a single, slow nod. The unspoken message was clear: You made the right call.
Even through the haze of pain, Jarren’s programming kicked back in. He opened his eyes, his breathing ragged. “See?” he gasped, trying to force a grin. “All done. Just wrap it tight. I can hit.”
He was still fighting. Still trying to prove he could go back to the park.
I stepped forward and put a hand on his shoulder. It was the first time I had touched him.
“The argument is over, Jarren,” I said, my voice firm, but laced with a deep, undeniable empathy. “Your toughness is not, and has never been, in question. But you are not playing again today. You are not playing tomorrow. You are going on the Injured List, and you will not be activated until that hand is completely healed.”
He opened his mouth to protest again, to fight the good fight. But he looked past me and saw the look on Cora’s face. He saw the look on Casas’s face. He saw the grim reality of his own mangled hand, now being gently wrapped in layers of white gauze by the trainer.
For the first time, the fight went out of his eyes. He slumped back against the table, the adrenaline and defiance finally draining away, leaving only the quiet, throbbing agony behind.
He was safe. And he knew it. And everyone in that room knew why.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. Caked in blood and mud.> <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> <Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> <the debridement was an excruciating torture. Jarren kept the left hand still, but his whole body was shaking and almost curled into fetal position > <antiseptic brought agony beyond all aforementioned process> < trainer gently patted Jarren’s hand dry, apply antibiotic ointment>
<Jarren insisted on playing and put up a good fight after the treatment, but now everyone saw that Breslow was right.>
Considering the Scene's Dynamics
I'm currently focused on deconstructing the prompt's key details, particularly Duran's emotional state. I'm envisioning the scene's emotional core: the transition from the adrenaline of the game to the vulnerable setting of the trainer's room. I'm exploring how the contrast will influence the narrative.
Analyzing Duran's Trauma
I've been meticulously dissecting the specifics of Duran's injury, emphasizing the physicality of it to ensure I portray his pain accurately. The challenge is balancing the raw, graphic nature of the wound with a sensitive portrayal of Duran's stoicism and eventual vulnerability. The scene should highlight his internal struggle.
Examining Scene Composition
I'm now fully immersed in the trainer's room scene. I'm focusing on the environmental details: the sterile brightness, the tense quiet, and the contrast between that and Duran's brutal injury. I'm considering the physical reactions of the characters to the injury and the emerging argument, building up the emotional tension of the scene.
Refining Duran's Portrayal
I'm now zeroing in on Duran's physical reactions to the treatment. I'm focusing on his stoicism, the tension in his grip, and the sweat on his brow. The antiseptic becomes the pinnacle of his pain, and I want to convey that with detailed sensory writing. My goal is to paint a vivid picture of his inner conflict.
Crafting a Scene's Intensity
I'm now fully immersed in constructing the immediate aftermath of the injury. I'm focusing on the contrast: the sterile medical environment against the brutal reality of Duran's wound. I'm meticulously detailing Duran's stoicism as he endures the debridement process. I'm aiming for a poignant portrayal of his inner turmoil.
Focusing on Dialogue and Tension
I'm now crafting the dialogue between Breslow and Jarren, prioritizing a respectful yet firm approach from Breslow. The dialogue aims to highlight Jarren's internal conflict and Breslow's commitment to player preservation. The intent is to craft a scene that captures the core of their contrasting mentalities.
Constructing a Confrontation
I'm now zeroing in on the emotional core of the scene's climax, crafting Breslow's dialogue. The goal is to highlight the clash between old-school grit and modern player preservation. The argument's tone will be respectful but firm, emphasizing both the injury's severity and the new leadership's stance.

The sterile, white light of the trainer’s room was a harsh contrast to the soft green of the field I’d just left. The air smelled of antiseptic and athletic tape. When I walked in, the scene was one of quiet, controlled tension.
Triston Casas was leaning against a wall, his arms crossed, his face a mask of confusion and simmering frustration. He’d been pulled from a game for no reason he could fathom.
Jarren Duran was sitting on the edge of an examination table. Our head trainer, Jim, was leaning over him, his back to me. I didn’t need to see the injury to know it was bad. I could see it in the rigid set of Jarren’s shoulders.
I addressed Casas first. He deserved an explanation, or at least an acknowledgment.
“Triston,” I said, my voice calm and even. I walked over to him, keeping my voice low so only he could hear. “I know that made no sense out there. That was my call, not Alex’s. It was a gut decision based on the long game. We’ll talk more later, but I need you to trust me on this one. I’m sorry for the confusion.”
He looked from me to the scene at the examination table, then back to me. The anger in his eyes softened into bewilderment. He just nodded, accepting it for now.
I turned my attention to the table. “What are we looking at, Jim?”
Jim turned, and I got my first look at the hand. It was worse than I could have imagined. The entire pinky side of his left palm was a raw, angry wound, a third of its surface area simply gone. The skin had been scraped away, leaving a weeping, bloody mess of exposed tissue caked with the grit and clay of the warning track.
Jarren sat perfectly still as Jim began to clean the wound with a saline solution. He didn’t flinch. He didn’t make a sound. His gaze was fixed on a spot on the far wall. But his right hand told the real story. It was gripping the padded edge of the examination table, his knuckles bone-white, the muscles in his forearm corded with tension. A thin sheen of sweat had broken out on his forehead.
“Okay, Jarren,” Jim said, his voice low and professional. “Now for the hard part. I’ve got to get this debris out. Stay with me.”
The debridement began. It was an excruciating, meticulous torture. With each pass of the sterile tool, a fresh wave of pain shot through Jarren’s body. He kept the injured hand perfectly still, a monument to his impossible willpower, but the rest of him betrayed the agony. His body began to tremble, a fine, uncontrollable shaking. He curled in on himself, his shoulders hunching, his body instinctively trying to retreat into a fetal position, even as his hand remained offered and steady.
Then came the antiseptic.
The moment the liquid touched the raw tissue, a sharp hiss of breath escaped Jarren’s lips. His eyes squeezed shut. Every muscle in his body went rigid, as if he’d been electrocuted. It was a silent scream, a complete surrender to a pain beyond anything that had come before.
Finally, it was over. Jim gently patted the area dry with sterile gauze, his touch now impossibly soft. He applied a thick layer of antibiotic ointment and began to dress the wound.
The whole time, I had stood there, a silent witness. Casas had watched from the corner, his frustration completely gone, replaced by a look of horrified respect.
The moment Jim finished wrapping the hand, the warrior programming rebooted. Jarren took a deep, shuddering breath and finally looked at me.
“Okay,” he said, his voice raspy but firm. “Tape it up. I can hit. I can finish the game.”
I looked at him. I looked at the thick, white bandage that now encased his hand. I looked at the sweat still beading on his pale face.
“No,” I said. My voice was quiet, but it carried the weight of absolute finality.
“What do you mean, no?” he shot back, his eyes flashing with anger. “It’s just a scrape. I sat through that. I’m fine. I can play.” He started to get off the table.
“Jarren, stop,” I said, holding up a hand. I didn’t raise my voice. I didn’t need to. “I have no doubt that you can. What you just endured, sitting through that without making a sound, is one of the toughest things I’ve ever seen in a clubhouse. I mean that.”
I took a step closer. “But this is exactly what we talked about. This is the test. The old Jarren would go out there and try to prove he can play through it. The leader I need, the champion we’re trying to become, is smart enough to know that he can’t grip a bat properly. He can’t slide. He can’t perform at the level we need him to. He accepts that the smart play, the team play, is to let this heal.”
He stared at me, his jaw clenched, a war raging in his eyes. He wanted to fight. He wanted to argue. But he couldn’t. He looked down at his bandaged hand, then back at me. He looked over at Casas, who was now staring at the injury with a new, dawning understanding of why he, too, had been pulled. The evidence was overwhelming.
He slumped back onto the table, the fight draining out of him, replaced by a weary, frustrated resignation. He had lost the argument.
Everyone in the room knew I had been right. The new culture had won its first battle. And the cost was nothing more than a few confusing minutes on the field, and a pain that was now, finally, on its way to being healed.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. Caked in blood and mud.> <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> 
<stop the scene here. I’ll provide you with more details on the treatment.>
The door to the trainer’s room hissed open and I stepped inside. The familiar scent of rubbing alcohol and athletic tape hit me, a sterile counterpoint to the living smells of the ballpark. The controlled chaos of the game was replaced by a tense, focused silence.
Two scenes were playing out at once.
On a training table to my right, Triston Casas was sitting, his expression a mixture of confusion and simmering frustration. A trainer was going through the motions of checking his knee, a charade we had agreed upon as the official reason for his removal. Casas was answering in monosyllables, his eyes darting toward the door, then toward me, demanding an explanation.
But my focus was on the scene to my left.
Jarren Duran was perched on the edge of another table, his back to me. The head trainer, Brandon Henry, was hunched over him, working under the bright glare of an examination lamp. I could see the muscles in Jarren’s back and shoulders, coiled tight as springs. He wasn’t saying a word.
I walked over, my footsteps quiet on the rubberized floor. Brandon looked up at me, his expression grim. He gave a slight, almost imperceptible shake of his head, a silent confirmation that this was worse than a simple scrape.
I moved to stand beside Jarren, looking down at his hand.
And my breath caught in my throat.
The woman’s description had not done it justice. This wasn’t a scrape. It wasn’t a cut. It was a flaying. A huge patch of skin on the heel of his palm, near the pinky, was simply gone. The raw, glistening, pinkish-white tissue beneath was exposed, weeping a mixture of blood and fluid. Specks of rust-colored dirt and black turf pellets were embedded in the wound, making it look like something from a battlefield.
It was a grotesque, brutal injury, made all the more shocking by its mundane cause.
Jarren didn’t look at me. He just stared at his own mangled hand, his jaw clenched so tight I could see the muscles twitching along his jawline. He was silent, but his silence was screaming. It was the silence of a man trying to process a level of pain he refused to acknowledge, his mind warring with the raw, undeniable evidence of his own body’s trauma.
I placed a hand gently on his shoulder, my grip firm and steady.
“I saw the dive,” I said, my voice low and calm, devoid of any panic or alarm. “That was one of the best catches you’ll ever make. You saved a double, maybe a triple.”
I let the praise sink in first. Acknowledged the warrior.
Then, I addressed the reality.
“And now we’re going to make sure you’re able to make another one next week, instead of being out for a month because this got infected.”
I looked at Brandon. “What’s the protocol?”
Brandon, all business, didn’t miss a beat. “We have to debride it. Get all that turf and dirt out. It’s going to hurt like hell. Then we disinfect, bandage it. He’s not touching a bat or a glove for at least 72 hours, maybe more. We have to see how it responds.”
I nodded, my hand still on Jarren’s shoulder. He hadn’t moved. He hadn’t spoken. He was a statue of coiled, silent fury. The fury wasn’t at me, or at the situation. I knew, with chilling certainty, that it was directed entirely at his own body for failing him, for being weak enough to get injured.
I squeezed his shoulder gently. “You hear that, Jarren? You made the play. Now we do our job. We’re going to take care of this.”
I turned my attention to the other side of the room, to the confused and angry first baseman whose season I had just saved.
“Triston,” I said, my voice calm and authoritative. “My office. Now.”
I needed to separate them. I had to explain the unexplainable to Casas, and I had to give Jarren the space to endure the painful treatment that was about to begin, without an audience. The two fronts of the battle required two different strategies.
<Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> <You can add more details.> <stop the scene here. I'll provide you with more details about debridement>
Revisiting Prompt Details
I've been meticulously dissecting the prompt, focusing on Jarren Duran and his post-dive injury. The abrasion on his hand is a central point to explore. I'm imagining the scene in the trainer's room, considering the possible implications of his injury.
Exploring Cleaning Procedures
I'm now zeroing in on the cleaning process. I'm focusing on the contrast between the sterile environment and Jarren's pain. The crinkle of the wipe packet, the quiet concentration of Brandon Henry, and Jarren's stoic grip on the chair are all central. I'm imagining the sting of the antiseptic and the subtle shift in Jarren's posture as the trainer begins.
Refining Emotional Nuance
I'm now diving into the emotional aspects, specifically Jarren's response. I'm focusing on his stoicism and internal conflict, thinking about how his physical pain likely compounds with emotional frustration. I'm trying to capture the subtle tension of his clenched grip and the brief flicker in his eyes. I'm imagining his thoughts, unspoken, as Brandon begins the cleaning.
Building the Tension
I'm now zeroing in on Jarren's stoic front. I'm carefully constructing the scene, focusing on the contrasting sounds and atmospheres. I'm working to describe the clinical quiet and the intensity of his suppressed emotions. The sounds of the trainer's tools and the sting of the antiseptic will juxtapose the athlete's quiet determination, emphasizing his intense focus. I'm focusing on making his posture and breathing speak volumes.
Analyzing Inner Conflict
I'm now zeroing in on Jarren's stoicism and internal conflict. The recent immersion into the scene has shifted my focus to the physical and emotional. I'm imagining the controlled breath, the clenched jaw, and the subtle flicker in his eyes. I'm focusing on his attempt to control his internal pain. I'm building a picture of the scene with the intention of emphasizing the deep understanding gained from our time traveler.
Analyzing The Athlete's Stoicism
I'm now zeroing in on Jarren's stoicism and internal conflict. The recent immersion into the scene has shifted my focus to the physical and emotional. I'm imagining the controlled breath, the clenched jaw, and the subtle flicker in his eyes. I'm focusing on his attempt to control his internal pain. I'm building a picture of the scene with the intention of emphasizing the deep understanding gained from our time traveler. I also continue to consider the context of the training room and the sounds within.
Creating a Visceral Scene
I'm now integrating the details, weaving the quiet intensity of the trainer's room with Jarren's internal battle. I'm focusing on the contrast between the clinical process and Jarren's stoicism, aiming to convey his silent rage and determined focus. The scene is coming together with the goal of providing a visceral experience, emphasizing the emotional subtext through physical detail. The controlled atmosphere will juxtapose his inner pain.
As the door clicked shut behind Casas, the atmosphere in the room shifted. The air, already thick with tension, became heavy, focused entirely on the man sitting on the table. The low hum of the overhead examination lamp seemed to grow louder, more insistent.
I moved back to Jarren’s side, standing as a silent, supportive presence.
Brandon Henry worked with a grim, practiced efficiency. He snapped on a pair of blue nitrile gloves. He tore open sterile packages, the crinkling plastic loud in the quiet room. He laid out gauze pads, a bottle of saline solution, and a set of long, sterile tweezers.
“Alright, Jarren,” Brandon said, his voice calm and professional, a stark contrast to the brutal reality of the injury. “First, we flush. This is going to sting.”
Jarren didn’t respond. He didn’t even look up. His eyes were fixed on a scuff mark on the floor, his entire being focused on that single, insignificant point, as if he could will himself somewhere else.
Brandon aimed the stream of saline at the wound.
The moment the cool liquid hit the raw, exposed nerve endings, Jarren’s entire body went rigid. A sharp, almost imperceptible intake of breath was the only sound he made. His back straightened, the muscles along his spine turning to stone. His right hand, which had been resting on his thigh, shot out and clamped onto the padded edge of the examination table.
He squeezed.
I watched as the color drained from his knuckles, turning them a waxy, bloodless white. The tendons in his forearm stood out like steel cables. He was pouring every ounce of the searing, electric pain from his left hand into his right, grounding it into the unfeeling table.
Brandon worked methodically, flushing away the larger pieces of dirt and blood, his movements gentle but firm. With each pass of the saline, a fresh wave of agony seemed to pass through Jarren. A thin sheen of cold sweat broke out across his forehead and temples, glistening under the bright lamp. It was the only outward sign of the war he was fighting, the body’s involuntary betrayal of the mind’s iron control.
He didn’t make a sound. Not a whimper, not a curse, not a groan. There was only the harsh, controlled rhythm of his breathing and the relentless, crushing pressure of his right hand on the table. It was the most violent silence I had ever witnessed. He was back in the park with his father, refusing to run home, refusing to cry. He was proving he could take it.
I rested a hand on his shoulder again, a light but firm pressure. “Stay with us, Jarren,” I said softly, my voice barely above a whisper. “You’re doing great. Just breathe.”
He gave no indication that he heard me. He was locked inside himself, a prisoner of his own unbreakable will.
After a few moments that felt like an eternity, Brandon set the saline bottle down. He picked up a sterile gauze pad.
“Okay,” the trainer said, his voice low. “The surface is clean. Now for the hard part. I have to get those embedded particles out. This is where it gets real.”
<the debridement was a long and excruciating torture.>
<some tissues had to be cut. Some particles are buried so deep that trained had to make a cut on the tissue to get the particle out>
<Jarren’s whole body was shaking and almost curled into fetal position. > 
<He even told the trainer ‘It’s clean. Stop it.’>
<add more details>
<stop the scene there. I’ll provide you with more details about antiseptic>
The saline flush had been a prelude. The debridement was the main event, a slow, meticulous, and agonizing excavation.
Brandon picked up the sterile tweezers. “Alright, Jarren,” he said, his voice even lower now, almost a murmur. “I’m going to be as quick as I can.”
He leaned in, the bright light of the lamp creating a stark, clinical circle on Jarren’s mangled hand. He touched the tip of the tweezers to the edge of the wound.
Jarren’s body convulsed. It was a single, violent shudder, as if a jolt of electricity had shot through him. The hand gripping the table clenched so hard I thought the padding might tear. His head bowed, his chin tucking into his chest.
Brandon worked with the focus of a bomb disposal expert. Tweezers in, a tiny, embedded black speck of turf out. A wipe with a blood-soaked gauze. Repeat. Each pluck of a foreign particle was a fresh, searing insult to the raw nerves.
The silence was broken. Not by a scream, but by a low, guttural sound, a noise forced from deep in his chest, halfway between a grunt and a groan. It was the sound of a body betraying a will that refused to surrender.
After the fifth or sixth particle was removed, his control began to fray at the edges. His whole body started to tremble, a fine, high-frequency tremor that radiated out from his core. The sweat on his forehead was no longer a sheen; it was beading up and rolling down his temples, tracing paths through the grime of the game.
“Some of this is too deep,” Brandon muttered, more to me than to Jarren. “I have to cut.”
He set down the tweezers and picked up a small, sterile scalpel.
The sight of the blade seemed to break through Jarren’s trance. He looked up, his eyes wide with a mixture of pain and a dawning, desperate panic.
“No,” he rasped, his voice hoarse, unrecognizable. “No, it’s clean. It’s good enough.”
“It’s not, Jarren,” Brandon said gently but firmly. “If we leave this in, it gets infected. You could get sepsis. This is non-negotiable.”
The first small, precise cut of the scalpel sent a shockwave through him. His back arched off the table, his teeth clenched in a silent scream. The hand gripping the table slipped, and he almost fell. I instinctively moved, my hands hovering near his shoulders, ready to steady him.
He curled in on himself then, his shoulders hunching, his body trying to shrink away from the source of the pain. He was almost in a fetal position on the edge of the table, a strong, powerful athlete reduced to a shivering knot of agony.
“Stop,” he pleaded, the word a choked whisper. “Please. It’s clean. Stop it.”
It was the first time I had ever heard him say the word ‘please’ in a context of asking for mercy. It was the voice of the little boy running home from the park, finally having had enough.
My heart broke for him.
I stepped forward, placing my hand firmly on his trembling back, rubbing a slow, steady circle.
“Brandon,” I said, my voice calm and authoritative, cutting through the tension. “Stop for a minute.”
The trainer immediately pulled back.
I leaned down, my face close to Jarren’s ear. “Jarren. Listen to me,” I said, my voice low and steady. “You’re right. This is torture. And you’ve taken more than any man should have to. But he has to finish. Your season could depend on this. We are not letting you lose your season over this.”
I kept my hand on his back, the steady pressure a grounding force. “So we’re going to do this. But we’re not doing it like this. Brandon,” I said, looking up at the trainer. “Give him a minute. Then give him a rolled-up towel to bite down on. And I want another trainer in here. One to help hold him steady. We’re not letting him do this alone anymore.”
I looked back at Jarren’s bowed head. “We’re right here with you,” I said softly. “We’re not leaving. We’re going to get through this together.”
The door opened and another trainer, a burly man named Dave, came in. He gave me a grim, knowing nod. He had seen this kind of thing before. He moved to Jarren’s side, opposite Brandon, and gently but firmly took hold of Jarren’s left wrist and forearm, immobilizing it. Jarren didn’t have the strength to resist.
Dave handed Jarren a tightly rolled white towel. “Bite down on this, son,” he said, his voice a low, calming rumble. Jarren, his eyes squeezed shut, took it between his teeth.
Just then, the door opened again. It was Alex Cora. He took in the scene in a single, sweeping glance—the lamp, the scalpel, the sweat-soaked player curled in on himself—and his face, usually a mask of competitive fire, softened into one of deep, paternal concern.
He didn’t say a word to me or the trainers. He walked directly to Jarren. He knelt down in front of the table, so he was at eye level. He gently took hold of Jarren’s head, his hands cupping his ears, and guided it forward until Jarren’s forehead was resting against his chest, against the soft fabric of his manager’s pullover.
“I got you, J.D.,” Alex murmured, his voice so low it was almost inaudible. “I’m right here. You’re not alone.”
I moved back to my position, my hand once again on Jarren’s back, my other hand on his shoulder, providing a steady, grounding pressure to keep him from collapsing entirely.
The four of us formed a protective circle around him. A fortress of support.
“Okay, Brandon,” I said quietly. “Let’s finish this.”

The debridement resumed. It was a brutal, painstaking process. The scalpel would make a tiny incision, the tweezers would probe and pluck, and each time, Jarren’s body would be wracked with a fresh wave of tremors. The towel in his mouth muffled the guttural sounds of pain, but we could feel them. They traveled through his body, up Alex’s chest, through my hands. We absorbed the shocks with him.
Time seemed to warp in the small, sterile room. Minutes stretched into an eternity, measured not by the clock on the wall, but by the agonizingly slow progress of Brandon’s work. The pile of blood-soaked gauze pads on the metal tray grew. I kept up the slow, steady circles on his back, a constant, rhythmic reminder that he was not just an injury being treated, but a person being cared for. I could feel the frantic, rabbit-quick beating of his heart through his shirt.
Alex never moved. He just held Jarren’s head, murmuring quiet, unintelligible words of encouragement, a constant stream of support. “That’s it… breathe through it… almost there, kid… we’re right here…”
Finally, after what felt like a lifetime, Brandon set the tweezers down with a soft, final click. He wiped the last bead of blood from the wound with a fresh piece of gauze.
“It’s done,” he said, his voice heavy with exhaustion. “All the debris is out.”
He stepped back from the table. The immediate, intense source of the pain was gone.
The tension in Jarren’s body did not release. It simply changed. The violent, pain-induced tremors subsided, replaced by a deep, shuddering exhaustion. He spat the sweat-and-tear-soaked towel onto the floor. His head remained buried in Alex’s chest, his shoulders shaking with silent, ragged breaths. He was completely and utterly spent.
The fortress held. No one moved. We just gave him the silence, the space to feel the aftermath of the battle he had just endured. We had gotten him through it. Together.
<antiseptic brought agony beyond all aforementioned process> 
<If Jarren had enough strength left, he would have fled at the mention of antiseptic>
<Jarren has never experienced anything like that>
<Jarren used all his will to prevent himself from rolling on the ground>
The brief respite was just that: brief. The silence in the room was heavy with the knowledge that the worst was yet to come.
Brandon took a deep breath, steeling himself. He picked up a new bottle, its label a stark, clinical black and white. Betadine. The dark, reddish-brown liquid was the color of dried blood. It was salvation and damnation in a bottle.
“Alright, Jarren,” Brandon said, his voice gentle, but laced with an unavoidable gravity. “This is the last step. We have to sterilize it completely. This is going to be the worst part. I’m not going to lie to you.”
At the word “antiseptic,” a new kind of tremor went through Jarren. It wasn’t the sharp, electric shock of the debridement. It was a deep, full-body shudder of pure, primal dread. He tried to pull his head back from Alex’s chest, a weak, instinctual movement of an animal trying to flee a trap. If he’d had an ounce of strength left in his body, he would have bolted from the table.
But he was spent. He was a prisoner of his own exhaustion.
Alex held him firm, his grip gentle but unyielding. “Easy, son. Easy. We’re at the finish line. Don’t quit on me now. Look at me.”
Slowly, Jarren lifted his head. His face was pale, ghostly, streaked with sweat and tears he hadn’t known he’d shed. His eyes, usually burning with competitive fire, were wide with a raw, pleading terror I had never seen in another human being. He looked like a child facing down a monster.
“I can’t,” he whispered, the words cracking, broken. “I can’t do more.”
“Yes, you can,” I said, my voice firm but full of a conviction I had to believe. I moved my hand from his back to his right hand, the one that had been gripping the table. I wrapped my own hand around his, prying his stiff fingers open and lacing mine with them. His hand was cold, clammy. “You can. We’re not letting go. Look at me, Jarren. We are right here.”
He squeezed my hand, his grip surprisingly strong, a last desperate anchor in a sea of pain.
Brandon uncapped the bottle. He soaked a large, thick gauze pad until it was dripping with the dark antiseptic.
“On three,” he said, a final mercy. “One… two…”
He didn’t wait for three. He pressed the soaked pad firmly onto the raw, open wound.
And the world ended.
Jarren’s body became a single, rigid arch of pure, silent agony. A strangled, inhuman sound was ripped from his throat, a sound that had no place in this world. It was the sound of every nerve ending in his hand screaming at once, a symphony of chemical fire.
His eyes, which had been locked on mine, squeezed shut, but the tears forced their way through his clenched lids. His head snapped back, his teeth grinding together with a sound I could hear across the room. His entire body vibrated, a low, violent hum of a system completely overloaded. He was using every last shred of his will, every fiber of his being, to keep himself from writhing on the floor, from screaming until his lungs gave out.
Alex absorbed the violent backward thrust of his head, murmuring a constant stream of “I got you, I got you, I got you,” like a mantra. Dave held his arm steady against the instinct to rip it away. I held his other hand, my own knuckles white, feeling the desperate, crushing transfer of his agony into my own bones.
It lasted for ten seconds. It lasted for a thousand years.
Then, as quickly as it began, it was over. Brandon lifted the pad.
The aftermath was terrifying. Jarren went completely limp. The arch in his back collapsed. His head lolled forward onto Alex’s shoulder. The hand in mine went slack. For a terrifying second, I thought he had passed out.
But he hadn’t. He was just… gone. He had retreated somewhere deep inside himself where the pain couldn’t follow. His body was still there, on the table, trembling with the aftershocks, but the man, the consciousness, was somewhere else entirely. He had endured. He had survived. But the cost was absolute.
<antibiotic ointment and bandage>
<Cora held weak Jarren like holding his own son>
<For the first time, Jarren admitted his sufferings>
<Out of pure habit, Jarren insisted on playing, but Breslow made the decision for him>
The silence that followed the antiseptic was different. It was the silence of a battlefield after the battle is over, thick with the smell of smoke and the weight of what was lost. The only sound was Jarren’s ragged, shallow breathing.
Brandon worked quickly now, his movements gentle, almost reverent. He squeezed a thick, clear line of antibiotic ointment onto a sterile tongue depressor and spread it carefully over the angry, weeping wound. It was an act of healing, of closing the door on the pain. Jarren didn’t even flinch. He was beyond feeling it.
Then came the bandages. Layers of non-stick pads, followed by soft, thick gauze, and finally, a wrapping of white self-adhering tape, creating a thick, protective cocoon around his hand. The brutal injury was hidden away, contained.
The procedure was over.
Alex Cora didn’t let go. He shifted his position, moving from kneeling to sitting on a stool beside the table. He wrapped his arms around Jarren’s trembling, exhausted frame, pulling him close until Jarren was leaning fully against him, his head resting on his manager’s shoulder. He held him not like a player, but like his own son, rocking him gently, a silent, comforting motion.
For a long moment, nothing happened. Then, a sound broke the stillness. A quiet, choked sob. Then another.
Jarren Duran, the warrior, the man who refused to show pain, finally broke. The iron walls he had built around himself his entire life crumbled to dust. He didn’t weep loudly. It was a quiet, exhausted, and utterly heartbreaking surrender. The tears he had held back since he was a boy in a park finally fell, soaking the shoulder of his manager’s uniform.
No one spoke. We just bore witness, giving him the dignity of his grief, the safety to finally let go. My own throat was tight, my eyes burning. This was more important than any game, any pennant. This was a man beginning to heal.
After several minutes, the sobs subsided into shuddering breaths. He stirred, pulling back from Alex’s embrace, though he still leaned against him for support. He wiped his face with the back of his good hand, a gesture of profound vulnerability.
He looked at his bandaged hand, then at me, his eyes red-rimmed but clear for the first time.
“Thank you,” he whispered, the words raspy. It wasn’t just for the medical care. It was for staying. For holding him. For not letting him go through it alone. For the first time, he wasn’t just enduring pain; he was accepting comfort.
A flicker of the old programming sparked. “When can I play?” he asked, the question a reflex, a deeply ingrained habit. “Tomorrow? I can DH.”
I looked at Alex, and he looked at me. We shared a silent, absolute understanding.
I stepped forward and knelt down, so I was at his eye level, just as Alex had been.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice soft but firm, leaving no room for the old arguments. “Listen to me. Your only job for the next three days is to rest. Your only job is to let this heal. You are going on the 10-day Injured List. It is not a discussion. It is not a negotiation. It is what we are doing to protect you.”
He started to protest, the instinct to fight, to prove himself, still there. “But the team…”
“The team will be fine,” I cut him off gently. “The team needs you healthy in July, not a hero in May. Your teammates saw you dive for that ball. They know what you did for them. Now, you are going to let us do our job for you.”
I reached out and put my hand on his knee. “You have done enough. You have fought enough for one day. The fight is over. We’ll take it from here.”
He looked from my face to Alex’s. He saw the same unwavering resolve in both of us. He saw the wall he was used to running through was now a circle of protection around him.
He searched our faces for any sign of disappointment, of seeing him as weak. He found none. He only found care.
Finally, for the first time in his life, he surrendered. He gave a slow, exhausted nod.
“Okay,” he whispered. “Okay.”
The battle was over. The war for his future had just begun. And for the first time, he wasn’t fighting it alone.
<Jarren finally gathered enough strength to walk out. His teammates heard the sound and realized what happened. They comforted him like brothers.> <No one see him as weak. Just care and support.> <add more details>
With a final, steadying nod from Alex, Jarren slowly, carefully, slid off the examination table. His legs were unsteady, trembling with the residual shock and exhaustion. He stood for a moment, swaying slightly, a powerful athlete suddenly as fragile as glass. Alex kept a hand on his back, a silent, supportive presence.
I opened the door to the main clubhouse.
The room, usually a cacophony of music, laughter, and chatter, was quiet. The game was still being played on the TVs mounted on the walls, but no one was watching. The players—veterans and rookies alike—were scattered around, sitting on stools, leaning against their lockers, their expressions a mixture of concern and grim understanding. They had heard the muffled sounds. They knew.
As Jarren stepped through the doorway, a silhouette of exhaustion under the bright clubhouse lights, a hush fell over the room. Every eye turned to him.
He kept his gaze fixed on the floor, his bandaged hand held protectively against his stomach. He looked like a soldier returning from a battle he wasn’t sure he had won. He started the long, lonely walk toward his locker at the far end of the room.
He didn’t get three steps.
Rafael Devers was the first to move. He pushed himself off his stool, walked over to Jarren, and simply stood in his path. Jarren stopped, finally looking up. Raffy didn’t say a word. He just opened his arms and wrapped his friend in a massive, gentle bear hug, being careful of his injured hand. He held him for a long moment, patting his back softly. It was a hug that said, I’ve been through my own wars. I see you. I’m here.
When Raffy let go, Kenley Jansen was there. The stoic, veteran closer put a hand on Jarren’s shoulder. “You’re a warrior, kid,” he said, his deep voice rumbling with respect. “Now go rest. We got this.”
It was like a dam breaking. One by one, they came to him. Not with loud words or boisterous back-slaps, but with a quiet, profound reverence. Trevor Story gave his shoulder a firm squeeze. Nick Pivetta, who had his own share of battles, gave him a nod of pure, unadulterated respect.
Then came the rookies. Roman Anthony, his face etched with a concern that went beyond baseball, just looked at him and said, “We’re glad you’re okay, man.” Ceddanne Rafaela, the one who had shielded him from the fan in Cleveland, simply put a fist out. Jarren, using his good hand, gently bumped it. It was a silent acknowledgment of a shared understanding.
No one saw weakness. No one saw a player who couldn’t handle the pain. They saw their brother, who had gone through hell for the team, and they were closing ranks around him. They saw the cost of the spectacular catch, and their respect for him had only deepened. They were showing him, in the clearest way possible, that his value to them was not conditional on him being invincible.
I stood by the door with Alex, watching the scene unfold. This was it. This was the culture we had been fighting to build, manifesting in the most powerful way imaginable. It was a quiet, sacred moment in the heart of the clubhouse.
Finally, Jarren reached his locker and sank onto the stool, his body trembling with a new kind of emotion. It wasn’t pain. It wasn’t exhaustion. It was the overwhelming, unfamiliar feeling of being completely and unconditionally supported. He buried his face in his good hand, hiding the fresh tears that were falling.
But this time, they were not tears of agony or loneliness. They were tears of relief. He was home. And he was safe.
<Doctors decided to keep Jarren here tonight for further observation, in case of infection and fever.> <Breslow and Coraset their worktable by Jarren's bed. Giving comfort when Jarren had nightmare or stirred uneasily in his sleep> <add more details>

The decision from the head of the medical staff was swift and non-negotiable.
“He’s not going home,” Dr. Adams said, his face stern after examining the wound and the exhausted man attached to it. “The risk of infection with an abrasion that deep, with that much foreign material involved, is too high. I want him on an IV antibiotic drip as a prophylactic, and I want him monitored overnight for fever or any other signs of sepsis. He’ll stay in the infirmary.”
The clubhouse infirmary was a small, quiet room just off the main training area, with a single bed, a few monitors, and a window that looked out onto the concrete service level of the ballpark. It was sterile, functional, and a world away from the adrenaline of the game.
Jarren, too weak to protest, simply nodded and allowed the trainers to help him change into a set of comfortable sweats. Once he was settled in the bed, a nurse hooked up the IV line to his good arm. The slow, steady drip of the antibiotic solution was the only sound in the room.
The game ended. We won. No one cared. The victory felt trivial, a footnote to the real battle that had been fought that night.
As the stadium slowly emptied and an evening quiet settled over the building, the infirmary became the new command center. I had Kevin bring a small folding table and two chairs from a spare office. We set it up near the foot of Jarren’s bed. Alex and I sat down, our laptops open, the glow of the screens casting long shadows on the wall.
We worked. We answered emails. We discussed roster moves for the next day, who to call up from Worcester to take Jarren’s spot. We talked about the upcoming series. We did our jobs. But our presence was the real work.
Jarren drifted into a shallow, fitful sleep, his body finally succumbing to the profound exhaustion. But his mind was still at war.
Around 11 PM, he cried out. A sharp, muffled sound. His head thrashed on the pillow, his body twitching. His breathing grew rapid, panicked. He was back on the table. He was back in the park.
Alex was on his feet in an instant. He moved to the bedside and placed a hand gently on Jarren’s shoulder. “Hey. J.D.,” he said, his voice a low, calming murmur. “You’re okay. You’re safe. It’s over. We’re right here.”
Jarren’s eyes fluttered open, wide with a glassy, unfocused terror. He stared at the ceiling for a moment before his gaze found Alex’s face. Recognition dawned, and the panic slowly receded, replaced by a wave of weary confusion.
“Bad dream,” he mumbled, his voice thick with sleep.
“I know,” Alex said softly. “Just a dream. Go back to sleep. We’re watching over you.”
Jarren’s eyes drifted shut again. Alex stood there for a long minute, just watching him, before returning to his chair.
An hour later, it was my turn. He stirred again, not with a nightmare, but with a low groan of pain. He tried to shift his position in the bed and jostled his bandaged hand. His face contorted in his sleep, a mask of pure agony.
I got up and walked to his side. The nurse had left a cup of ice chips on the bedside table. I took a small plastic spoon and gently touched it to his dry, parted lips.
He woke with a start, his eyes blinking in the dim light. He saw me, and the pain in his expression was mixed with a deep, profound exhaustion.
“Hurts,” he whispered, the admission a monumental step.
“I know,” I said, my voice quiet. “The nurse said you can have more pain medication in about thirty minutes. Just hang on. Try to rest.”
I pulled the blanket up a little higher on his shoulder. “We’re here, Jarren. Nothing’s going to happen to you.”
He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod and drifted off again.
And so the night went. A silent, shared vigil. We worked, we watched, we waited. We were the guardians at the gate, the sentinels standing watch over a hard-won peace. We were no longer just his GM and his manager. We were his shield. We were proving, in the quiet, lonely hours of the night, that our promise was not just words spoken in an office. It was a living, breathing commitment. We were separating the player from the person, and tonight, we were here for the person.

Exploring the Scenario
I've begun dissecting the prompt, focusing on the core premise: a perfect 2024 AL Pennant win. I'm exploring the implications of "everything going right," specifically the impact of Pivetta pitching instead of Buehler, and the ideal handling of the Devers/Bregman situation. This deconstruction is laying the groundwork for a detailed, plausible scene.
Defining Craig's Mindset
I'm now fully immersed in Craig's internal state. He's moved past expecting the woman's warnings, but they still weigh heavily. I'm imagining his vigilance in this new timeline, balanced with his confidence in the team. The blowout score sets up a perfect contrast for the jarring return of the past. The focus is on the crucial transition point where Duran is mentally disengaged, setting up maximum impact for the jarring cry from the stands.
Refining Craig's Response
I'm zeroing in on Craig's reaction to the unfolding situation. The blowout score now seems critical: it lulls everyone into a false sense of security. I'm exploring how Craig's heightened vigilance, born from the woman's warnings, intersects with his trust in the new team protocols. The contrast between expected celebration and the jarring interruption will amplify the impact.
Expanding the Aftermath
I'm now focusing on how Craig's preparation directly manifests in the immediate aftermath of the fan's outburst. The 13-3 score allows for a crucial mental lapse from the team. I'm visualizing the camera's focus on Duran's shocked expression and the quick, disciplined response of Cora, Bregman, and the entire Red Sox team, as I have been briefed that this team has been built around such a situation. I'm detailing the quick, decisive actions of the umpires, the crowd, and security, creating a stark contrast to the previous timeline's chaos.
Expanding the Scene
I've further developed Craig's internal state. The high-scoring game now sets the stage for a dramatic contrast. I'm focusing on his initial reaction of dread, followed by a surge of protective pride as he witnesses the team's decisive action. The crucial calls he makes, particularly to Cora and security, will showcase his leadership and commitment to the new timeline's protocols.
Developing Craig's Role
I'm now integrating Craig's responses throughout the crisis. I'm focusing on his initial shock, followed by his immediate activation of the new protocols. I'm refining how his leadership manifests through decisive phone calls and unwavering support for his players. His understanding of the situation is paramount.
Defining the Response
I'm now zeroing in on Craig's actions after seeing the unfolding drama on TV. The high score's importance is apparent. I'm focusing on his quick communication with Cora and Red Sox security. The contrast of the team's decisive response, facilitated by his prior effort, against the backdrop of a seemingly routine win further highlights his effectiveness.
The television in my office was on, as it always was during games, but the sound was low. It was background noise, a comforting rhythm to my evening paperwork. April 27th, 2025. A Saturday. We were in Cleveland, playing the series finale. The new timeline was beautiful. We had won the pennant in ’24. Duran was healthy and happy. Devers, after a long and respectful offseason conversation, had embraced his role as a leader and primary DH, welcoming Bregman as a key piece to a championship puzzle. Pivetta, not Buehler, was our big pitching signing, and he was dealing.
The game was a laugher. 13-3 in the top of the seventh. I was half-watching, half-smiling. This was the team I had envisioned. Powerful, deep, and mentally sound.
Duran was at the plate. He flew out to center field. A routine play. He peeled off toward our dugout on the first-base side, his head down in minor, competitive frustration.
And then I saw it.
It wasn’t a sound I heard. It was a motion. A sudden, violent stillness. He stopped dead in his tracks on the grass, halfway to the dugout. His head snapped to the side, toward the stands just past first base. The camera, following him, caught the instantaneous shift in his entire being. The casual trot of a professional athlete became the rigid, coiled posture of a man who had just been struck.
My blood ran cold. The pen fell from my hand and clattered onto the desk.
“No,” I whispered to the empty room. “Not again. It can’t be.”
On the screen, I saw Alex Cora pop out of the dugout, his eyes locked on Duran. He knew. He had been trained for this. In the on-deck circle, Alex Bregman straightened up, his practice swings forgotten, and took a step toward Duran.
The broadcast team was confused. “Duran seems to have stopped… taking exception to something a fan has said,” Will Flemming narrated, his voice cautious. “You can see Alex Cora is already on his way out…”
But before Cora could get there, the new timeline asserted itself.
Duran didn’t scream. He didn’t curse. He took one step toward the stands, his face a mask of cold, controlled fury, and then he stopped himself. He turned, his eyes searching, and found the first base umpire. He pointed. He was talking, his gestures sharp, precise. He was reporting it. He was using the system. He was asking for help.
And then the cavalry arrived.
It wasn’t a charge. It was a formation. A living wall. Bregman was there first, putting a hand on Duran’s shoulder, his body physically shielding him from the stands. Devers was right behind him, his face grim, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bregman. They were a united front. Then came Rafaela, his young face a mirror of fierce loyalty, standing just behind Jarren, a silent guard. The dugout had emptied. Not with aggression, but with a quiet, unshakeable solidarity. They surrounded their brother.
My hand, trembling, reached for the phone. But I paused. I watched as the home plate umpire strode toward the section Duran had indicated. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t wait for the half-inning. He stopped the game. He pointed into the crowd, and stadium security, already moving, converged.
This was it. This was the proof. All the meetings, the new protocols, the conversations with the league about player safety—it was working.
I dialed Cora’s number.
“Get him out of there, Alex,” I said, my voice low and tight. “Get him in the clubhouse. Now.”
“Already on it, Craig,” Cora’s voice came back, strained but steady. “The team’s got him.”
I hung up and immediately dialed our head of security. “I don’t care that we’re in Cleveland. I want a name. I want a police report. I want his picture sent to every security head in the league. He is banned from Fenway for life before his mugshot is even processed. Make it happen.”
I didn’t wait for a reply. I hung up and stood, pacing the office, my heart a wild drum against my ribs. I watched the television as security escorted a man, red-faced and belligerent, from the stands. The fans around him were pointing, helping, their faces etched with disgust. The hate was an island, drowned in a sea of decency.
The team enveloped Duran, guiding him back to the dugout, a phalanx of protection. He was hidden from the cameras, swallowed by his teammates.
The game eventually resumed. But I wasn’t watching anymore. I was thinking about the aftermath. About the man, not the player.
An hour later, my phone buzzed. It was a text from Alex Cora.
He’s okay. Shaken. We’re with him in my office. The guys have been rotating in and out. Raffy, Bregman, Pivetta. They’re not letting him be alone. He cried. I think that’s a good thing this time. He’s not fighting it. He’s letting us help carry it.
I sank into my chair, the tension leaving my body in a single, shuddering wave. I read the text again. He’s letting us help carry it.
I thought of the woman, of her story of a lonely robot protecting a galaxy. She was wrong. He wasn’t alone anymore.
My own phone buzzed again. I looked down. It was a text from a number I didn’t recognize, but I knew who it was from. It was from Devers.
Craig. We got him. He’s our brother. Don’t worry.
I leaned back and closed my eyes, the image of that human wall on the field burning bright behind them. The burden was immense. But tonight, for the first time, I knew with absolute certainty that I wasn't the only one carrying it.

<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen>
<The doctor had to dug out concealed debris under muscle fibers>
<Cora held Jarren in his arms>
<Casas and Craig restrained him>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before antiseptic>
The scissors slid through the layers of gauze, each soft snip sounding like a gunshot in the tense, silent room. As the final layer was cut away, the specialist peeled back the dressing.
A collective, sharp intake of breath, a horrified echo of the first time, filled the room.
The wound was no longer just raw. It was an angry, swollen, inflamed crater. The edges were a furious red, and the surrounding skin was hot and puffy. It was the sight of a body at war with an invasion, and losing.
“Okay,” the specialist said, his voice a low, grim monotone. “Let’s get this done.”
The injections of lidocaine were the first assault. Even in his semi-conscious state, Jarren’s body reacted with violent, instinctual force. A deep, guttural moan rumbled in his chest, and his body arched off the bed, a reflexive, full-body flinch against the needle pricks.
Cora, already in position, wrapped his arms around Jarren’s torso, pulling him back down, murmuring soft, useless words of comfort. Casas and I moved to his legs, holding them steady as they began to kick out with a surprising, fever-fueled strength.
Then came the debridement.
It was a nightmare. The tissue, already inflamed and hypersensitive, reacted to the touch of the forceps and scalpel with an intensity that made the first procedure seem like a minor discomfort. The specialist had to probe deeper this time, his instruments disappearing into the swollen flesh, hunting for the microscopic enemies that were poisoning Jarren’s system.
Jarren was no longer just moaning. He was screaming. Not with the conscious terror of before, but with a raw, mindless, animalistic agony. They were the sounds of a body being pushed beyond its absolute limits, a symphony of pure, neurological pain.
He thrashed on the bed, his head whipping from side to side on the pillow. His eyes were squeezed shut, his face a contorted mask of suffering. We were no longer just holding him; we were restraining him, a desperate, three-man effort against the violent, convulsive strength of a body in revolt.
“I’ve got something,” the specialist grunted, his focus absolute. He leaned in closer, his forceps disappearing into the deepest part of the wound. “It’s under the muscle fiber. I have to… pull it loose.”
The moment he applied pressure, Jarren’s scream pitched higher, a thin, unholy shriek that seemed to go on forever. His back arched with such force that it lifted Cora off the bed.
“Hold him!” the specialist commanded, his voice tight with strain.
I threw my entire body weight across Jarren’s legs, pinning them to the mattress. Casas did the same, his face a pale, sweat-slicked mask of horrified determination. We were wrestling with a man who was fighting for his life, without even knowing it.
The specialist gave a final, sharp tug. “Got it,” he breathed, pulling the forceps out. Clamped in the tiny metal jaws was a minuscule, almost invisible speck of dark matter. A single grain of sand. The source of all this agony.
He worked for another ten minutes, a brutal eternity, hunting for any other hidden fragments. Each touch, each scrape, sent fresh waves of torment through Jarren’s body, each scream tearing another piece from the souls of the men holding him down.
Finally, he set the instruments down. “Okay,” he said, his voice hoarse. “It’s clean. I’m sure of it this time.”
He looked at the nurses. “Get the Betadine.”
The room fell silent, save for Jarren’s ragged, gasping breaths and the frantic, steady beep of the heart monitor. We were all bruised, sweating, and emotionally shattered. And the worst part was yet to come.
<The mention of Betadine woke up the wild animal>
<Jarren’s eyes opened, but they were wild, with no consciousness. In the frenzy of fever and agony, he was fighting the demons.>
<Jarren threw Casas, Cora and Craig off, doctors backed up into a circle>
<add more details>
<stop the scene here before the second attempt was made>
The word “Betadine” acted like a key, unlocking a deeper, more primal level of terror in Jarren’s fevered mind.
His screams stopped. The mindless thrashing ceased. He went preternaturally still for a single, terrifying moment.
Then his eyes snapped open.
But it wasn’t Jarren looking out. It was something else. Something wild. His eyes were wide, unfocused, burning with a delirious, feral light. There was no recognition in them, no consciousness. It was the look of a cornered animal, a creature pushed beyond pain and into a state of pure, unthinking survival.
A low, guttural growl rumbled in his chest.
Before any of us could react, he moved.
It was an explosion of pure, adrenaline-fueled, fever-driven power that was beyond human. He bucked upward with a force that was impossible, a violent, convulsive eruption of every muscle in his body.
He threw me and Casas off his legs as if we were children. I stumbled back, crashing into a supply cart. Casas, a mountain of a man, was thrown sideways, his back hitting the wall with a sickening thud.
Cora, who was still holding Jarren’s torso, took the brunt of it. Jarren twisted, his arms flailing, and shoved his manager with a strength that sent Cora staggering back several feet.
In the space of two seconds, Jarren was off the bed. He wasn’t standing. He was crouched on the floor, his back against the wall, his bandaged, brutalized hand held protectively to his chest. His head was on a swivel, his wild eyes darting between all of us. He was panting, his chest heaving, the growl in his throat a constant, menacing hum.
The room was frozen in a state of shocked, terrified silence. The doctors and nurses, their faces pale with alarm, backed away, forming a loose, helpless circle around the room. The specialist held the bottle of Betadine like a useless talisman.
This wasn’t a patient anymore. This was a wild animal, trapped and terrified, ready to fight anything that came near it.
“Jarren,” Cora said, his voice a low, soothing murmur, taking a slow, cautious step forward. “Mijo, it’s me. It’s Alex. You’re safe.”
Jarren’s head snapped toward the sound, his lips pulling back from his teeth in a silent snarl. He didn’t hear the words. He only saw a threat. He pushed himself further into the corner, his body coiled like a spring, ready to launch.
We were at an impasse. He was unreachable, lost in a world of fever and pain and ghosts. We couldn’t get near him to help him, and every second we waited, the risk of the infection spreading grew. The Betadine, the one thing that could save him, was the one thing his terrified mind would not allow near him. We were trapped, helpless spectators to a war being fought inside a man’s soul.
<the first doctor who was brave enough stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass on the cabinet with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. Perfectly aimed, the doctored dodged it, falling to the ground on his butts. It almost gave the doctor a haricut.>
<Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning>
<It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done>
<add more details>
<stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
The specialist, a man of science and reason, made a calculated decision. He believed he could break the stalemate with calm, professional authority. He took a slow, deliberate step forward, his hands raised in a placating, non-threatening gesture.
“Jarren,” he said, his voice firm but gentle. “My name is Dr. Alpert. We are trying to help you. You have a serious infection. We need to apply the antiseptic.”
He crossed an invisible line on the floor, the boundary of Jarren’s terrified personal space.
The reaction was instantaneous and shockingly violent.
Like a viper striking, Jarren’s good hand shot out. With uncanny speed and precision, it snatched a heavy glass water carafe from the bedside cabinet. In the same fluid motion, he hurled it. It wasn’t a wild, panicked throw. It was aimed. It flew through the air with terrifying velocity, aimed directly at the doctor’s head.
Dr. Alpert yelped, his professional demeanor shattering, and threw himself backward. The glass carafe whistled past where his head had been a split second before, missing him by inches. It smashed against the far wall with an explosive crash, showering the floor with glittering shards of glass and water. The doctor landed hard on his backside, his face white with shock, staring at the spot where the carafe had impacted. It had been close enough to give him a haircut.
The room was plunged into a new, more dangerous silence. Jarren remained crouched in the corner, his chest heaving, his wild eyes now scanning the room for the next threat. He had a weapon now. The floor around him was littered with jagged shards of glass.
A nurse, seeing the doctor on the floor, took a step forward to help him.
“ROOOOAAAARRRR!”
The sound that erupted from Jarren’s throat was not human. It was a deep, primal, chest-rattling roar of pure warning. A sound that said, Do not come closer. The nurse froze, her hand flying to her mouth, her eyes wide with terror.
It was brutally, terrifyingly clear. The situation had escalated beyond our control. There would be no more coaxing. There would be no more reasoning. Any attempt to approach him would be met with violence.
Dr. Alpert scrambled to his feet, his composure gone, replaced by a grim, clinical urgency. He turned to me and Cora.
“That’s it,” he said, his voice shaking slightly but his resolve firm. “We have no choice. The risk of him hurting himself or someone else is too high. And we have to get that Betadine on him. I’m calling for a sedative. A heavy one. We’re going to have to put him under.”
He pointed to one of the nurses. “Get me five milligrams of midazolam in a syringe. Now.”
The nurse, grateful for a clear instruction, scurried to the crash cart.
I looked at Jarren, crouched amidst the broken glass, a wild animal backed into a corner, and my heart broke. We had failed. We had pushed him too far, and now we were resorting to the one thing we had tried to avoid. We were going to have to chemically restrain him, to render him completely unconscious, just to save his life. It felt like a profound defeat.
The nurse returned with the syringe, holding it like a weapon of last resort. The doctor took it, his face set.
“Okay,” he said, taking a deep breath. “We’re going to have to rush him. Three of us. One to control the arms, one the legs, while I administer the injection. It’s not going to be pretty.”
He looked at me, at Cora, at Casas. He was asking for our help. He was asking us to physically assault our player, our brother, for his own good.
The room was thick with a terrible, helpless dread. We were about to cross a line from which there was no easy return.
<Cora realized it was the white uniform and scent of antiseptic on the medical staff that scared Jarren. That’s why the line for doctors was further than the line for him, Casas and Craig>
<He saw the helplessness beneath the rage. >
<Cora stepped up with open hands, showing he had nothing to hurt Jarren>
<Jarren seemed to regard Cora as less of a threat. Reluctantly let Cora came near.>
<Cora talked Jarren into going back to the bed, holding him like his own son>
<Craig and Casas held Jarren>
<the medical staff tried to do this without sedative>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before their second attempt>
As the doctor laid out the grim battle plan, Cora’s eyes weren’t on the syringe. They were locked on Jarren. He wasn’t seeing a wild animal. He was looking deeper, past the fever, past the feral rage, to the terrified child underneath. He saw the way Jarren’s eyes darted toward the blue scrubs and the white coats with a specific, targeted terror. He saw that the invisible line of defense was five feet away for the medical staff, but only three feet for me and Casas.
He saw the pattern.
“Wait,” Cora said, his voice a low, sharp command that cut through the tension. He held up a hand to the doctor. “Stop. Give me a minute.”
He looked at me, his eyes full of a sudden, dawning understanding. “It’s the uniforms,” he whispered. “It’s the smell. It’s them. He thinks they’re here to hurt him. He sees them as the source of the pain.”
He turned his gaze back to Jarren, his expression softening, his entire posture changing. He was no longer a manager or a part of the restraining force. He became a father again.
He took a slow, deliberate step forward, into the dangerous space. He kept his hands open, palms forward, showing they were empty. He was making himself vulnerable.
“Jarren,” he said, his voice a soft, gentle murmur, completely different from the doctor’s clinical tone. “Mijo. It’s just me. It’s Alex. No doctors. Just me.”
Jarren’s head snapped toward him, a low growl rumbling in his chest. But it was different. There was a flicker of confusion in his wild eyes. He saw the familiar face, heard the familiar voice. It didn’t compute with the threat he perceived. He remained coiled, tense, but he didn’t roar. He didn’t reach for a piece of glass.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” Cora continued, taking another slow, shuffling step. “No one is going to hurt you. We’re just going to get you back to the bed. It’s safe there. I’m right here.”
He was close now, just outside of arm’s reach. Jarren watched him, his breathing still ragged, his body still trembling. He was a wolf deciding if the approaching figure was a threat or a member of its own pack.
“It’s okay, campeón,” Cora whispered, his voice impossibly soft. He extended a hand, slowly, palm up. “It’s okay. Let’s go back to the bed. I’ll stay with you. I promise.”
For a long, heart-stopping moment, Jarren remained frozen, a statue of conflict. Then, with an almost imperceptible shift, the tension in his shoulders eased. The feral light in his eyes dimmed, replaced by a flicker of exhausted, terrified recognition. He looked at Cora’s outstretched hand, then back at his face.
With a low, shuddering whimper, he uncoiled. He didn’t take Cora’s hand, but he allowed him to close the final distance. Cora moved in smoothly, wrapping his arms around Jarren’s trembling frame, shielding his view from the rest of the room.
“That’s it, mijo,” Cora murmured into his ear. “I got you. Let’s go.”
He began to guide Jarren, half-walking, half-carrying him, away from the corner, away from the broken glass. Jarren was pliant now, his strength gone, his trust placed entirely in the one man who had broken through the fevered haze.
Cora gently helped him sit on the edge of the bed, his back to the medical staff. He kept his arms around him, a constant, protective presence.
He looked over his shoulder at me and Casas. His eyes were pleading. Help me.
We moved in, our movements slow, deliberate. Casas took his position, his hand resting gently on Jarren’s leg. I stood behind him, my hands on his shoulders. We were the human brace again.
Cora looked at the specialist, his expression a silent, desperate command. Try again. Now. No sedative.
The doctor, his face a mixture of awe and apprehension, gave a single, sharp nod. He understood. This was their only chance to do this without resorting to the needle.
He handed the bottle of Betadine and a fresh piece of gauze to the head nurse, a woman with steady hands and kind eyes. He motioned for the rest of the staff to stay back, to reduce the number of white coats in Jarren’s line of sight.
The nurse approached the bed slowly, from the side, trying to remain out of Jarren’s direct view. She uncapped the bottle. The sharp, chemical scent filled the air again.
Jarren flinched, a tremor of remembered agony running through him. He tried to pull away, a low moan escaping his lips.
“Shhh, I’m right here,” Cora whispered, holding him tighter. “It’s okay. It’s the last time. I promise. It’s the last time.”
The nurse soaked the gauze, her movements silent and swift. She took a deep breath. We all did.
The second attempt was about to begin.
<a split second before the Betadine was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony>
<But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment>
<add more details>
<keep the scene in the antiseptic process. I’ll provide more details>
The nurse, her face a mask of compassionate resolve, moved the Betadine-soaked gauze toward Jarren’s hand. The air grew thick, heavy with the anticipation of the inevitable agony.
In that final, suspended split-second before contact, as Cora held his player, his son, a devastating realization struck him. It was a flash of pure, terrible insight that went beyond the physical pain.
He looked down at the top of Jarren’s head, buried in his chest, and he finally, truly, understood.
Jarren wasn’t just afraid of the sting. He wasn’t just afraid of the fire. He was afraid of why it was happening. In his fevered, traumatized mind, there was only one context for this level of deliberate, focused pain administered by an authority figure: the park. He wasn’t just bracing for a medical procedure. He was bracing for a punishment. He believed, on a primal, subconscious level, that he had done something wrong, and this was the consequence. This was his father, yelling “Be better!” with a baseball in his hand.
Cora’s arms, which had been a source of comfort, suddenly felt like a cage. He was holding Jarren in place for the punishment. He was participating in the trauma. The realization was a physical blow, and a look of profound, soul-deep anguish crossed his face.
But there was no way back.
The nurse pressed the gauze to the wound.
The scream that followed was different from before. It was not the wild, feral roar of a cornered animal. It was the heartbroken, betrayed cry of a child who cannot understand why the person who is supposed to protect him is allowing this to happen.
“NO! DADDY, NO!” he shrieked, the words a torrent of pure, undiluted agony and confusion.
He thrashed, but it was a different kind of struggle. It wasn’t a fight to escape. It was a desperate, pleading writhe, a full-body question: Why are you doing this to me?
Cora’s face was a portrait of torment. He was caught in an impossible trap. Every instinct screamed at him to let go, to save this boy from the pain. But his mind, his duty, knew he had to hold on. To let go would be to condemn him to a greater danger. So he held him. He held him as he screamed. He held him as he begged. He became the monster to save the child.
“I’m sorry, mijo,” Cora choked out, tears streaming down his face, his voice a raw, broken whisper against Jarren’s hair. “I’m so sorry. Forgive me. It’s to make you better. I’m sorry.”
He was no longer just comforting him. He was pleading for his forgiveness, echoing the apology his own father would one day wish he could make.
Casas and I held on, our own faces etched with the horror of it. We were no longer just restraining a player. We were holding down a son for a father who was trying to save his life. The room was filled with the sounds of Jarren’s heartbroken cries and Alex Cora’s whispered, desperate apologies. It was a crucible of love and pain, a terrible, necessary, and unforgivable act of healing.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 48 hours, Jarren has no fight left>
<He was back to the park>
<He thought this was the punishment for his failures>
<For not swinging the best >
<Not growing up>
<the Tapia inside the park homerun>
<dropped two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that>
<dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again>
<struck out with the bases loaded>
<caught stealing and picked off>
<add more details>
<keep the scene in the antiseptic process. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
The fight bled out of him, replaced by a chilling, desolate surrender. He stopped thrashing. His body went limp, a dead weight in Cora’s arms, his only movement the violent, uncontrollable shudders that wracked his frame. He was no longer in the room. He was gone. He was back in the park.
The antiseptic wasn’t a medical treatment. It was a sentence, delivered for a lifetime of perceived crimes. His fevered mind, seeking a reason for the unbearable, found it in the well-worn grooves of his own self-loathing. Each searing wave of pain was a specific punishment for a specific failure.
His lips moved, his voice a faint, ghostly murmur, a confession whispered to the ghosts only he could see.
“Didn’t… didn’t swing right…” he mumbled, his body twitching as the Betadine found a fresh nerve. The memory of his father’s anger, of the first baseball striking his small body, was as real as the fire in his hand. “Sorry… be better…”
Another wave of pain, another whispered sin.
“Too small…” he choked out, a tear leaking from the corner of his closed eye. “Didn’t grow… sorry, Dad…”
The nurse, her own face streaked with tears, continued her terrible, necessary work, her hands trembling slightly.
“Tapia…” he gasped, his body arching as a particularly sharp pain shot up his arm. He was seeing it: the ball rolling to the wall in Toronto, the moment of hesitation that cost him, the humiliation of the inside-the-park home run. “My fault… didn’t… didn’t run…”
Cora held him tighter, his own body absorbing the tremors, his face buried in Jarren’s hair, unable to watch the litany of self-flagellation.
“Kansas City…” Jarren’s voice was a faint, broken thing. “Dropped it… dropped two… fans were right… so mad…” He was back in the outfield at Kauffman Stadium, the sun in his eyes, the ball glancing off his glove, the anger of the crowd mirroring the fury in his own heart.
The memories came faster now, a torrent of failure unleashed by the unrelenting pain.
“Couldn’t… couldn’t smother it…” he cried, reliving a diving play, the ball skittering away, the runner taking an extra base. “Tried… not good enough…”
“Bases loaded…” he whimpered, his breath catching in a sob. “Struck out… let everyone down…”
“Picked off…”
“Caught stealing…”
Each memory was a fresh ghost, a fresh reason for the torment. He was a man being flayed alive by his own past. He had built his entire identity on the idea that he could overcome any pain, that he could always get back up, always go back to the park. But now, in this moment, he was being punished for every time he had ever fallen. He was trapped in a hell of his own making, convinced, finally, that he deserved it.

<He apologized, he pleaded,sometimes speaking like a grown-up, sometimes like a child>
<He promised to be good, be better, act like All-Star MVP every night>
<He swear he would do anything, if only the punishment could stop>
<add more details>
The litany of his failures dissolved into a desperate, incoherent stream of bargaining. He was a soul on trial, pleading with a silent, merciless judge. His voice shifted, a phantom echo of his life’s journey, one moment the articulate cadence of a 26-year-old man, the next the high, pleading tones of a terrified child.
“I’m sorry,” he gasped, his voice mature, rational, the voice of the man who stood before the media and took responsibility. “I know I can be better. I’ll work harder in the cage. I’ll fix the mechanics. I promise.”
A fresh wave of pain, and the man vanished, replaced by the boy.
“Please,” he cried, his voice cracking, small and thin. “I’ll be good. I won’t talk back. I’ll swing right. Please, Daddy, stop.”
He was trying every tactic his mind could conjure to make the torment cease. He made promises. He swore oaths. He offered up his future as a sacrifice to appease the ghosts of his past.
“All-Star MVP,” he mumbled, the words slurring together, his body trembling violently as Schneider meticulously worked on a particularly sensitive area. “I’ll… I’ll be that guy. Every night. I swear. No more slumps. No more mistakes. I’ll be perfect.”
He was offering up his own impossible standard as a plea bargain. He was trying to appease the monster by promising to become the very thing the monster demanded: an infallible machine.
Cora, his own face a mask of anguish, just held him tighter, whispering, “No, mijo, no. You don’t have to be. Just be you. That’s enough.”
But Jarren couldn’t hear him. He was lost in his own desperate negotiation with his demons.
“Anything,” he choked out, his voice breaking into a raw, ragged sob. “I’ll do anything. Just… just make it stop. Please. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. Please make it stop.”
It was the cry of a soul that had been pushed beyond endurance, beyond reason, into a place of pure, desperate supplication. He was willing to promise away his future, his identity, his very being, if it would only grant him a single moment of peace from a punishment he believed he had earned. The room was thick with the sacred, terrible sound of a man breaking, and the quiet, helpless love of the men who were trying to hold the pieces together.
<Jarren finally gave up on negotiations>
<He just endured it, fully accepted his punishment, more convinced than ever he deserved  that.>
<add more details>
The bargaining stopped. The pleas faded into a chilling, desolate silence. A profound, terrifying shift occurred in the room, a change in the very quality of his suffering.
He gave up.
It wasn’t a surrender to comfort or a release into unconsciousness. It was a surrender to the punishment. He stopped fighting it. He stopped trying to understand it. He accepted it as his due.
His body, which had been a tense, writhing knot of resistance, went unnervingly still. The tremors lessened, replaced by a dead, heavy stillness. He lay limp in Cora’s arms, no longer clinging to him for comfort, but merely existing within his embrace, a prisoner resigned to his fate.
His breathing, which had been ragged and panicked, evened out into a slow, shallow rhythm. His face, which had been a contorted mask of agony and terror, went slack, his expression becoming one of utter, hollow-eyed vacancy. He was no longer there. He had retreated to a place so deep inside himself that the pain was just a distant, academic fact. It was happening to his body, but his soul had already been condemned.
He was back in the park, but he was no longer begging. He was standing still, letting the baseballs hit him.
The murmurs stopped. The apologies ceased. There was only the sound of the nurse’s movements, the soft squelch of the gauze on the wound, and the quiet, steady beep of the heart monitor, a lonely metronome marking the time in hell.
He was fully convinced, in the deepest, most broken part of his being, that this was justice. That every searing wave of pain was a righteous penance for a lifetime of failure. For not being big enough. For not being strong enough. For every strikeout, every error, every moment of weakness. He had finally accepted the verdict of the cruel, silent judge in his mind.
Guilty.
Cora felt the shift instantly. The desperate, clinging child was gone, replaced by this terrifyingly placid shell. He looked up from Jarren’s still form, his eyes meeting mine over Jarren’s shoulder. The look on Cora’s face was one of pure, unadulterated horror. He, too, understood what had just happened.
We were no longer just witnessing a medical procedure. We were witnessing a man’s spirit being crushed under the weight of his own history. We were watching him accept a life sentence for crimes he had never committed. And there was nothing we could do but hold him and wait for it to be over.
<the antiseptic finished>
<imagine the reaction of everyone>
<add more details>
The nurse lifted the Betadine-soaked gauze from the wound for the final time. She set it down on the metal tray with a soft, wet slap that echoed in the dead silence of the room.
“Done,” she whispered, her voice trembling.
The word hung in the air, but it brought no relief. The fire was out, but the landscape was a charred, smoking ruin.
For a long moment, no one moved. We remained in our positions, a frozen tableau of shared trauma. Cora still cradled the unnervingly still form in his arms. Casas’s hand was still a heavy, useless weight on Jarren’s leg. My hands were still on his shoulders, feeling the profound, terrifying emptiness where a vibrant, fighting spirit had been just minutes before.
Slowly, as if moving through a dream, we began to disengage.
Cora gently eased Jarren back against the pillows, his movements full of a tenderness that was heartbreaking to watch. Jarren’s head lolled to the side, his eyes open but vacant, staring at nothing. He didn’t seem to register the change, or the cessation of the pain. He was still gone.
Casas took a stumbling step back, his face ashen. He looked at his own hands, then at Jarren, then at the floor. He opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. He just shook his head and walked to the far corner of the room, turning his back on the scene, his broad shoulders slumped in a posture of utter defeat.
The specialist, Dr. Alpert, who had been a silent, grim observer, stepped forward. He checked Jarren’s vitals, his professional demeanor a thin veneer over his own shaken state. He listened to his heart, checked his pulse, shone a light in his unresponsive eyes.
“His vitals are stable,” the doctor said, his voice a clinical, hollow sound. “The fever is already starting to break. The antibiotics and the cleaning… medically, he’s on the right path.” He paused, looking at Jarren’s vacant expression. “Psychologically… that’s another story.”
The nurse who had administered the Betadine was quietly weeping in the corner, her shoulders shaking as she tried to stifle her sobs. Another nurse came and put an arm around her, leading her from the room.
I looked at Cora. His face was a wreck. The strong, decisive manager was gone, replaced by a man who looked like he had aged ten years in the last hour. His eyes were red-rimmed, his expression haunted. He stared at Jarren, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. He had held his son through the punishment, and the guilt and horror of that act were etched on his face.
I felt a cold, profound emptiness inside me. We had won. We had saved his hand, likely saved his season, possibly saved his life. But the cost… the cost felt unbearable. We had dragged him through hell, and in doing so, we had validated his deepest, darkest belief: that he was a failure who deserved to be punished.
I walked to the bedside and looked down at him. His face was a blank canvas. The fighter was gone. The mentor was gone. The laughing, energetic soul of our team was gone. All that was left was this terrifyingly quiet, obedient shell.
I had made the right medical and strategic decision. I had followed the plan. I had saved the asset.
But as I stood there, in the wreckage of that small, sterile room, I had never felt more like a failure in my entire life.
<After a long while, Some light of consciousness went back to Jarren's eyes>
<Cora, Craig, Casas managed to help Jarren back, told him that wasn't punishment for his failure>
<Cora held Jarren in his arms, let him cry out all these trauma>
<add more details>
Time stretched and became meaningless. The only sound was the steady, lonely beep of the monitor. We were adrift in a sea of quiet despair.
Then, a flicker.
It was in his eyes. A subtle shift. The vacant, hollow look wavered, and a tiny spark of awareness, of confusion, ignited in their depths. His gaze drifted from the ceiling to the white bandage on his hand, and then to the faces surrounding him. He blinked slowly, like a man waking from a long, dark dream, trying to distinguish nightmare from reality.
“Alex?” he whispered, his voice a dry, cracked rasp.
Cora was at his side in an instant, his own face a mixture of hope and trepidation. “I’m here, mijo,” he said softly. “I’m right here.”
Jarren’s eyes focused on his manager’s face, and the memories began to flood back. The pain. The screaming. The ghosts. A look of profound, deep-seated shame washed over his features. He tried to pull away, to turn his face to the wall.
“I’m sorry,” he croaked. “I… I lost it. I was…”
“No,” I said, my voice firm, cutting him off before the self-recrimination could take root. I moved to the other side of the bed, forcing him to look at me. “Jarren, listen to me very carefully. What happened in here was not a punishment. Do you understand? It was not because you made an error or struck out or didn’t grow fast enough.”
He stared at me, his brow furrowed in confusion. The concept was alien to him.
Casas, seeing his opening, stepped forward. “Dude,” he said, his voice earnest and raw. “That was a medical procedure. A messed-up, brutal one, but that’s all it was. It wasn’t a punishment. It was us trying to keep you from losing your hand. That’s it. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“But… it hurt so much,” Jarren whispered, the logic of a lifetime fighting against our words. “It was… like…”
“I know what it was like,” Cora said, his voice thick with emotion. He sat on the edge of the bed and gently took Jarren’s good hand. “It was like the park. I know. I saw it in your eyes. But Jarren, look at me. I am not your father. This was not a punishment. This was a treatment. We were not hitting you with baseballs to make you better. We were trying to heal you.”
He leaned in, his eyes boring into Jarren’s, trying to will him to understand. “The love my father showed me was not the love you received. My love for you, our love for you, is not conditional. It does not depend on you getting a hit. It does not depend on you being tough. We love you. The man. Not the player. And we held you down and put you through that fire because we love you, and we could not bear to lose you to an infection. It was an act of love, mijo. A terrible, painful one, but it was love.”
The words, so contrary to everything Jarren had ever been taught, began to break through the wall of his conditioning. He looked from Cora’s impassioned face, to Casas’s earnest one, to my own steady gaze. He saw no anger. No disappointment. Only a deep, profound, and unwavering care.
The dam broke.
The vacant look in his eyes was replaced by a wave of pure, unadulterated grief. It was the grief for the little boy who had been punished for his failures. It was the grief for the young man who believed his worth was tied to his performance. It was the grief for a lifetime of misunderstood pain.
A single, hot tear rolled down his cheek. Then another.
Cora opened his arms. “It’s okay,” he whispered. “Let it go.”
Jarren collapsed into his manager’s embrace, and for the third and final time, he wept. But this time, it was different. It wasn’t the silent, stoic suffering of the first day. It wasn’t the heartbroken, betrayed cries of the second. This was a cry of release. A cry of grief. It was the sound of a lifetime of trauma finally being let go, of a terrible burden finally being set down.
Cora held him, rocking him, his hand stroking his back. He let him cry for the boy in the park, for the man in the mirror, for the pain he thought he deserved. He let him cry until the ghosts that had haunted him for twenty years were finally, finally washed away in a flood of unconditional love.
The medical staff, who had retreated to the periphery of the room, stood as silent, humbled witnesses. They were professionals, trained to detach, to view the body as a machine to be fixed. But what they had just seen transcended medicine. It was a raw, elemental exorcism of the soul, and it left them shaken.
Dr. Alpert, the infectious disease specialist, stood near the doorway, his arms crossed. His clinical demeanor had vanished, replaced by a look of profound, weary respect. He had seen the depths of physical pain many times, but he had rarely witnessed its direct, violent intersection with a lifetime of psychological trauma. He watched Cora hold Jarren, not as a doctor observing a patient, but as a man witnessing a profound act of healing that no scalpel or antiseptic could ever achieve. He had been the agent of the pain, the necessary monster, and now he was seeing the medicine of the heart do its work. A quiet, deep-seated understanding settled on his face: he had treated the wound, but Alex Cora was healing the man.
The head nurse, the one with the kind eyes and steady hands who had administered the Betadine, leaned against a counter, her own eyes wet. She had been the instrument of his torture, her hands the source of the fire. To see his agony transform not into rage or resentment, but into this deep, grieving release, was a powerful, emotional catharsis for her as well. She watched them, a soft, maternal smile touching her lips through her own tears. She had seen patients fight, scream, and curse. She had rarely seen one so completely and lovingly held together by his chosen family.
The younger nurses and the intern stood clustered together, their faces a mixture of awe and raw emotion. This wasn't something they had learned in nursing school. There was no chapter in their textbooks on how to handle a patient reliving childhood trauma while undergoing a debridement. They were seeing a masterclass in human connection, in empathy, in the kind of care that goes far beyond charts and vitals. They were learning that sometimes the most powerful medicine isn't in a syringe, but in a whispered word, a steadying hand, a father’s embrace.
Even Schneider, our head trainer, who knew these players better than most, was visibly moved. He had been focused on the mechanics of the procedure, on the clinical necessity of his actions. But now, seeing the aftermath, he understood the true scope of what had happened. He saw the player he worked on every day not just as a collection of muscles and tendons, but as a man with a history, with ghosts. His future interactions with Jarren, and with every player, would now be colored by this deeper understanding. He wasn't just taping an ankle anymore; he was caring for a soul.
There was a silent, unspoken consensus in the room. They would never speak of this outside these walls. What had happened here was sacred. They had been granted a glimpse into the deepest, most vulnerable corner of a man’s life, and they would guard that secret with a fierce, professional loyalty. They had come into the room as a medical team, but they would leave as keepers of a profound and human story.
<Jarren fell asleep in Cora's arms, the most peaceful sleep he had in days>
<Casa got confused about the "baseballs""get a hit""back to the park", Cora and Craig explained to him>
<add more details>
The storm passed. The great, shuddering sobs that had wracked Jarren’s body slowly subsided, replaced by the deep, even breaths of a man utterly spent. The grief had been a purge, a violent exorcism that had left him hollowed out, but clean. He didn’t pull away. He just sagged against Cora, his body pliant, his mind finally quiet.
Cora, sensing the shift, gently eased him back against the pillows. Jarren’s eyes were closed, his face, though still pale and tear-streaked, was relaxed for the first time in days. The deep furrows of pain and anxiety were gone, smoothed away by the profound release. Within moments, he was asleep. It wasn’t the shallow, feverish unconsciousness of before. This was a deep, peaceful, healing sleep. The sleep of a man who had finally set down a burden he had carried his entire life.
The three of us stood watching him for a long moment, a silent, shared breath of relief passing between us. The beeping of the heart monitor was slow and steady now, a peaceful rhythm that filled the quiet room.
Triston Casas finally broke the silence. He walked over from the wall, his face a mask of confusion and concern. He looked from Jarren’s sleeping form to me and Cora.
“Man,” he said, his voice a low, bewildered rumble. “I’m glad he’s okay. But… what was all that? The stuff he was yelling?” He shook his head. “It sounded like he was… a kid. Talking about getting a hit, going back to the park… and the baseballs. What was that about?”
Cora sighed, a deep, weary sound. He ran a hand over his tired face and looked at me. His eyes asked a silent question: How much do we say?
I gave a small, almost imperceptible nod. Casas had been in the crucible with us. He had been a part of the shield. He had earned the right to understand the battle he had just helped fight.
I gestured to the chairs. “Let’s step outside, Triston,” I said quietly. “Let him sleep.”
We walked out into the main trainer’s room, the three of us, and sank into chairs around an empty training table. The ballpark was silent around us.
I started, laying the groundwork, speaking in low, careful tones. “Triston, what you saw in there… it goes back a long way. To when Jarren was a little kid. He was always small for his age, and he had to fight for everything.”
Cora picked up the thread, his voice heavy with the weight of the story. “His father… he loves him. Deeply. But he was hard on him. Very hard. He’s an immigrant, he worked for everything he had, and he wanted his son to be special. He thought the only way to do that was to be tough. To push him.”
I watched Casas’s face as he listened, his expression shifting from confusion to a dawning, horrified understanding.
“The park,” I continued, my voice flat. “That was their training ground. And when Jarren didn’t perform, when he didn’t swing the way his dad wanted…” I paused, the words still tasting like poison. “His father would get angry. He would… he would throw baseballs at him. To punish him. To make him ‘better.’”
Casas’s jaw went slack. “He what?” he whispered, his eyes wide with disbelief.
“He would run home crying,” Cora said, his voice thick with emotion. “But he would always go back. Because his dad knew he would. Because Jarren couldn’t stand to fail. So the pain, the punishment… it got all tangled up in his head with love, with approval, with what it means to be tough.”
“So tonight,” I concluded, bringing it all together. “When he was in that much pain, his mind couldn’t process it as a medical procedure. It went back to the only other time he’s felt that kind of deliberate, focused pain. He thought he was being punished. He thought he was back in the park, a little kid who had done something wrong, begging his dad to stop.”
We sat in silence for a long moment. Triston Casas, the big, easygoing first baseman, stared at the floor, his mind reeling. He was processing the information, re-contextualizing every interaction he’d ever had with his teammate. The relentless hustle, the self-directed anger after a strikeout, the refusal to take a day off—it all snapped into a new, tragic focus.
“Holy shit,” he breathed, looking up at us, his eyes full of a new, profound sadness and respect. “So every day… every single day, he’s… he’s still that kid in the park.”
“Yes,” Cora said softly. “But today, for the first time, I think he finally got to go home.”
<The fever broke the next day. >
<Jarren woke up, only had some vague pieces of the ordeal.>
<Somehow he felt a heavy burden lift a bit>
<add more details>
The next morning, the light that filtered into the small medical room felt different. It was softer, less harsh. The frantic, urgent energy of the past 36 hours had dissipated, replaced by a quiet, hopeful calm.
The fever had broken in the dead of night. The number on the monitor was back in the double digits, a beautiful, normal 98.6. The IV drip still fed him antibiotics and fluids, but it was no longer a desperate lifeline; it was a tool for recovery.
Jarren was awake. He was sitting up in the bed, propped against a few pillows. The hollow-eyed, haunted look was gone. In its place was a deep, profound exhaustion, but it was a clean exhaustion, the weariness of a body that has fought a great battle and won.
He was quiet, his gaze drifting from his neatly bandaged hand to the window, where the morning sun was glinting off the buildings of Boston. He looked like a man trying to piece together a strange, fragmented dream.
Cora was in the chair beside him, a cup of coffee in his hand, the two of them sharing a comfortable silence. I was standing by the door when Jarren’s eyes finally found mine.
“Hey,” he said, his voice still rough, but clear.
“Hey, yourself,” I replied, walking over. “How are you feeling?”
He considered the question for a moment. “Tired,” he admitted. “Really tired. And… fuzzy.” He looked down at his hand again. “I remember… some of it. It’s like… flashes. The pain. And…” He trailed off, a flicker of the old shame crossing his face. “I think I… I think I lost it pretty bad.”
“You went through something pretty bad,” Cora said gently. “Nobody would have handled it any better.”
Jarren looked at his manager, then at me. He was searching our faces for any sign of judgment, of disappointment. He found none. There was only a quiet, steady relief.
“It’s weird,” he said, his voice a low murmur. He looked out the window again. “I feel… lighter.”
He couldn’t explain it. He didn’t have the words for it. He didn’t consciously remember the confessions, the childhood memories, the moment of surrender. But his soul remembered. The part of him that had been clenched into a tight, painful knot for twenty years had, in the crucible of the last two days, finally been allowed to unclench. The burden he didn’t even know he was carrying—the belief that he had to be perfect, that he had to suffer in silence, that love was conditional—had been lifted, just a little.
“I don’t know,” he said, shaking his head slightly. “I just… I feel different.”
“Good,” I said, a genuine smile touching my lips for the first time in what felt like a week. “Different is good. Right now, your only job is to feel that way. To rest. To heal. The team is handling business. We won yesterday, by the way.”
A flicker of the old Jarren returned, a small, competitive smile. “Yeah? Who hit a homer?”
“Raffy,” Cora said, grinning. “And Bregman. They said they were hitting them for you.”
Jarren’s smile widened. He looked down at his bandaged hand, then back at us. The shame was gone, replaced by a quiet, dawning gratitude. He didn’t understand all the pieces of what had happened. He didn’t know the full extent of the war that had been fought within these four walls.
But he knew one thing with a certainty that settled deep in his bones.
He knew he hadn’t been alone. And for the first time in his life, that felt like enough.
<Given the scare  yesterday, Doctors were very cautious when approaching Jarren><Jarren was confused><Casas, Craig, Cora made jokes about his fight with them, and with the doctors><add more details>
Later that morning, Dr. Alpert and the head nurse came in to check on him. Their approach was completely different from the day before. They were hesitant, cautious, their movements slow and deliberate. They stopped just inside the door, their expressions a mixture of professional concern and personal apprehension.
“Good morning, Jarren,” Dr. Alpert said, his voice carefully neutral. “We’re just here to check the dressing and take your vitals. How are you feeling?”
Jarren looked at them, his brow furrowed in confusion. He saw the way they were standing, the way they were watching him, as if he might suddenly erupt. He had no memory of the feral, cornered animal he had become. He only had a vague, dreamlike sense of their presence during the ordeal.
“I’m okay,” he said slowly, his eyes darting from the doctor to the nurse, then to me and Cora. “Why is everyone acting so weird?”
Before I could give a diplomatic answer, Triston Casas strolled in, a smoothie in each hand. He’d become a permanent fixture, the big brother of the vigil. He took in the scene, a wide grin spreading across his face.
“Oh, they’re just scared of you, dude,” Casas said, handing a smoothie to Jarren. “Yesterday, you went all Incredible Hulk on them. I think the doc is worried you’re gonna throw another water bottle at his head.”
Jarren’s eyes widened in genuine shock. “I did what?”
“Oh yeah,” Casas said, leaning against the wall. “Perfect strike. If he hadn’t ducked, you’d have given him a new part in his hair. It was impressive. A little terrifying, but impressive.”
I chimed in, a dry smile on my face. “I’ll say this, Jarren. For a guy with a mangled hand, your aim is impeccable. We might need to rethink your position. Maybe a pitcher?”
Jarren stared at us, a horrified, disbelieving laugh escaping his lips. “No way. I did not.”
“Mijo,” Cora said, his face straight but his eyes dancing with amusement. “You threw Triston and Craig off you like they were children. I think my ribs are bruised. I’m thinking of filing a grievance with the union.”
The room filled with a gentle, healing laughter. It was the first real laughter we had heard in days. We weren’t mocking him. We were demystifying the trauma. We were taking the terrifying, fragmented memories from his fever dream and reframing them, not as a source of shame, but as a wild, unbelievable story. We were telling him, without saying it directly, We saw you at your absolute worst, and we are still here, and we are not afraid.
Jarren looked down at his smoothie, shaking his head, a slow, rosy blush of embarrassment replacing the pale flush of shame. “Oh my God,” he mumbled. “I am so sorry.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Casas said, clapping him gently on his good shoulder. “Just give us a little warning next time you decide to go full beast mode. We’ll bring helmets.”
The doctor and nurse, seeing Jarren laugh, seeing the tension break, finally relaxed. They approached the bed, their movements now normal, professional. As the nurse began to check his vitals, Jarren looked at Dr. Alpert, his expression one of sincere, mortified apology.
“Seriously, doc,” he said. “I’m really sorry if I… you know.”
Dr. Alpert just smiled, a weary but genuine smile. “Jarren, all things considered, your aim was remarkable. Just do me a favor and save it for the opposing team from now on.”
The fear was gone. The shame was being replaced by a story they could all share. The healing, in more ways than one, had truly begun.
After the doctor and nurse finished their checks and left, a comfortable quiet settled over the room again. Jarren, propped up on his pillows, took a few sips of the smoothie Casas had brought him.
“Hey,” he said, his voice still a bit scratchy. “Could I get some water? My throat feels like sandpaper.”
“Of course,” I said immediately, standing up. I glanced at the bedside cabinet, my mind on autopilot, reaching for the familiar glass water pitcher that usually sat there for patients.
My hand closed on empty air.
I stopped, blinking. The cabinet was bare. And then, in a sudden, vivid flash, the memory of the previous day hit me with the force of a physical impact. The wild look in Jarren’s eyes. The shocking speed of his movement. The carafe whistling through the air. The explosive crash against the wall.
I looked from the empty cabinet to the far wall, where a faint, star-shaped crack in the plaster was visible if you knew where to look. Then I looked at Jarren.
He was watching me, a dawning horror on his face as he followed my gaze. The vague, dreamlike memory was solidifying into a sharp, mortifying reality.
“Oh, no,” he whispered, his eyes wide. “The… the pitcher. That was… that was me?”
Cora, who had been quietly reading on his phone, looked up and followed our line of sight. A slow, wicked grin spread across his face.
“Yep,” Cora said, popping the ‘p’. “That was you. Mission accomplished. One less water pitcher in the world. The Cleveland front office is probably sending us a bill as we speak.”
Casas, who was just about to take a sip of his own smoothie, choked back a laugh. “Dude, it was epic. You were like a ninja. A very angry, confused ninja in hospital socks. One second it was on the table, the next it was a missile.”
I couldn’t help it. A genuine, deep laugh escaped me. I leaned against the cabinet, shaking my head in disbelief. “I’ll be honest, Jarren,” I said, trying to catch my breath. “The velocity was impressive. The command was elite. If this whole baseball thing doesn’t work out, you might have a future as a… well, I’m not sure what, but it would definitely involve throwing things with pinpoint accuracy.”
Jarren groaned and covered his face with his good hand, the blush of embarrassment now a deep, fiery crimson. “I can’t believe I did that. I am never going to live this down.”
“Nope,” Casas said cheerfully. “Never. From now on, all breakable objects are going to be kept at a minimum safe distance of twenty feet from you at all times. It’s a new team rule.”
The room filled with laughter again, easy and genuine. It was a ridiculous, absurd moment, but it was also profoundly necessary. We were taking the most violent, terrifying moment of his delirium and turning it into a clubhouse joke, a legendary story. We were stripping it of its power to cause him shame. We were telling him that even at his most feral, his most out-of-control, he was still just our guy, JD, the guy who apparently had a cannon for an arm even when he was half-conscious.
“Alright, alright,” I said, wiping a tear of laughter from my eye. “I’ll go find you a plastic cup. And maybe a helmet for myself, just in case.”
As I walked out of the room to find a non-lethal source of water, I heard Casas say, “Seriously, man, the form was perfect…” The sound of Jarren’s groaning and Cora’s deep, rumbling laughter followed me down the hall. The healing was happening, one ridiculous, shared memory at a time.
<Doctors suggested Jarren get some food and drink><Jarren had no stomach for anything after two days of fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details>

After the laughter subsided, one of the nurses came in with a tray. On it was a bowl of chicken broth, some saltine crackers, and a cup of apple juice. It was the standard first meal after a fever, simple and bland.
“Doctor’s orders,” she said with a kind smile. “We need to get some fluids and calories in you. Start slow.”
She placed the tray on the rolling table and swung it over Jarren’s lap.
Jarren looked at the food, and a faint green tinge appeared around his gills. The very thought of eating, after two days of his system being ravaged by fever and pain, was nauseating.
“I… I can’t,” he said, shaking his head and gently pushing the table away. “No offense. I’m just… my stomach’s not ready.”
“You gotta eat something, man,” Casas said, gesturing with his now-empty smoothie cup. “Gotta get your strength back.”
“He’s right, Jarren,” I added. “Your body needs fuel to heal.”
But Jarren just shook his head again, a stubborn set to his jaw. “Later. I’ll try later. I just can’t right now.”
He was shutting down. It was a familiar pattern: when faced with something his body didn’t want to do, his first instinct was to refuse, to retreat.
Cora, who had been watching the exchange silently, stood up. He didn’t argue. He didn’t coax. He just moved with a quiet, paternal authority.
He took the bowl of broth from the tray. He picked up the spoon. He pulled a chair right up to the side of the bed, so he was sitting next to Jarren, their knees almost touching.
“Okay,” Cora said, his voice soft but firm, leaving no room for negotiation. “Here’s the deal. You’re not going to eat the whole bowl. You’re not going to eat the crackers. You are going to have three spoonfuls of this broth. That’s it. Three. For me.”
Jarren opened his mouth to protest, but Cora held up the spoon, a small amount of the clear, golden liquid glistening in it.
“This isn’t a negotiation, mijo,” Cora said, his eyes locking with Jarren’s. “This is what’s happening. Three spoonfuls. Then I’ll leave you alone.”
He wasn’t asking. He was telling. But it wasn’t the command of a manager. It was the firm, non-negotiable love of a father telling his sick child to take his medicine.
Jarren looked at the spoon, then at Cora’s unwavering, determined face. He saw the same look he had seen in the trainer’s room—the look that said, I am doing this because I care about you, and we are going to get through it together.
With a deep, resigned sigh, Jarren gave a small nod. He leaned forward and opened his mouth.
Cora gently fed him the first spoonful. Jarren swallowed, his throat working. He didn’t look happy about it, but he didn’t look like he was going to be sick, either.
“Good,” Cora said simply. “One.”
He dipped the spoon again. “Two.”
Jarren swallowed the second spoonful.
“One more,” Cora said. “That’s it. Then we’re done.”
He fed him the third spoonful. Jarren swallowed it and leaned back against the pillows, his expression one of weary relief.
“See?” Cora said, setting the bowl and spoon back on the tray. “Not so bad.” He reached over and patted Jarren’s leg. “Now you rest. Doctor’s orders.”
I watched the exchange, a quiet sense of awe settling over me. Cora hadn’t just gotten him to eat. He had, once again, gently but firmly dismantled one of Jarren’s defensive walls. He had shown him that sometimes, you have to let someone else take care of you, even when you don’t want to. He was re-parenting him, one spoonful of broth at a time, teaching him a new language of care and trust that had nothing to do with baseballs or batting practice.
<Jarren felt much better in the afternoon><He went to the dugout to watch the game.><Teammates joked to him><For the first time, he realized even if he could't contribute, his teammates loved him just the same><add more details>
By late afternoon, the transformation was remarkable. The combination of the antibiotics, the IV fluids, and the few hundred calories Cora had forced into him had worked a quiet magic. The color had returned to Jarren’s face, the deep exhaustion in his eyes had receded, and he was sitting up in bed, channel-surfing on the small TV with his good hand.
He was getting restless. The ingrained need to be with the team, to be part of the action, was starting to override the memory of the trauma.
“I can’t just sit here,” he said, throwing the covers off his legs. “The game’s about to start. I want to go to the dugout.”
Before I or the medical staff could protest, Cora held up a hand. “Okay,” he said, seeing the determined look in Jarren’s eyes. “Okay. But there are rules.”
He laid them out like a manager setting his lineup. “One: You are in a wheelchair. You are not walking that far. Two: You wear a hoodie and sweats. You are not in uniform. Three: You sit at the far end of the bench, out of the way, and you do not move from that spot. Four: The second you feel tired, you tell me, and we come right back here. Deal?”
Jarren, just grateful for the chance to escape the room, nodded eagerly. “Deal.”
Getting him into the wheelchair felt both absurd and necessary. He was a world-class athlete, but his body was still weak. As we wheeled him through the back corridors of the ballpark, he looked small, swallowed by the oversized Red Sox hoodie, his bandaged hand resting carefully in his lap.
When we emerged into the dugout just before the first pitch, the reaction was immediate and telling.
As he wheeled toward the far end of the bench, Kenley Jansen, who was leaning against the bat rack, stepped aside. He looked at Jarren’s bandaged hand, then at his face, and a slow grin spread across his lips.
“Hey, look who it is,” Kenley boomed. “The new team ninja. Try not to throw any water coolers at us, okay? We need those.”
Jarren ducked his head, a half-embarrassed, half-pleased smile on his face. “No promises.”
He settled into his spot on the bench, and Devers, who was getting ready to hit, came over and leaned down. “Hey, you feel good?” Raffy asked, his voice full of genuine concern.
“Yeah, man. Better,” Jarren said.
“Good,” Raffy said, patting his shoulder. “Now stay there. Don’t try to do anything heroic. We got this.”
Throughout the game, a steady stream of players and coaches made their way down to his end of the bench. They didn’t coddle him. They didn’t treat him like he was fragile. They treated him like one of them. They joked with him. They asked his opinion on a pitch sequence. They complained about an umpire’s call. They included him.
During a pitching change, Bregman came and sat next to him. “So, I heard you redecorated the trainer’s room,” he said with a wry smile. “Gotta say, I’m a little jealous. I just get a quad strain. You get a whole action movie sequence.”
Jarren laughed, a real, genuine laugh. “Yeah, well. I go big.”
He sat there for seven innings, a hoodie-clad cheerleader in a wheelchair. He couldn’t get a hit. He couldn’t steal a base. He couldn’t make a diving catch. He couldn’t contribute anything to the box score.
And as he watched his teammates fight, as he listened to their jokes, as he felt their easy, unconditional acceptance, a profound, revolutionary thought began to dawn on him.
They weren’t just being nice to him. They weren’t just tolerating his presence. They actually wanted him there. His value to them wasn’t just in what he could do on the field. They loved him. For him. Whether he was an All-Star MVP or a guy in a wheelchair with a bandaged hand.
For the first time in his entire life, he felt a sense of belonging that was not tied to his performance. It was not conditional. It was just… there.
As Cora wheeled him back to the medical room in the seventh inning, true to their deal, Jarren was quiet. He looked down at his bandaged hand, then out at the field where his brothers were playing.
A small, peaceful smile touched his lips. The park was no longer a place of judgment. It was just a place where he belonged. It was home.

Exploring the Scenario
I've begun dissecting the prompt, focusing on the core premise: a perfect 2024 AL Pennant win. I'm exploring the implications of "everything going right," specifically the impact of Pivetta pitching instead of Buehler, and the ideal handling of the Devers/Bregman situation. This deconstruction is laying the groundwork for a detailed, plausible scene.
Defining Craig's Mindset
I'm now fully immersed in Craig's internal state. He's moved past expecting the woman's warnings, but they still weigh heavily. I'm imagining his vigilance in this new timeline, balanced with his confidence in the team. The blowout score sets up a perfect contrast for the jarring return of the past. The focus is on the crucial transition point where Duran is mentally disengaged, setting up maximum impact for the jarring cry from the stands.
Refining Craig's Response
I'm zeroing in on Craig's reaction to the unfolding situation. The blowout score now seems critical: it lulls everyone into a false sense of security. I'm exploring how Craig's heightened vigilance, born from the woman's warnings, intersects with his trust in the new team protocols. The contrast between expected celebration and the jarring interruption will amplify the impact.
Expanding the Aftermath
I'm now focusing on how Craig's preparation directly manifests in the immediate aftermath of the fan's outburst. The 13-3 score allows for a crucial mental lapse from the team. I'm visualizing the camera's focus on Duran's shocked expression and the quick, disciplined response of Cora, Bregman, and the entire Red Sox team, as I have been briefed that this team has been built around such a situation. I'm detailing the quick, decisive actions of the umpires, the crowd, and security, creating a stark contrast to the previous timeline's chaos.
Expanding the Scene
I've further developed Craig's internal state. The high-scoring game now sets the stage for a dramatic contrast. I'm focusing on his initial reaction of dread, followed by a surge of protective pride as he witnesses the team's decisive action. The crucial calls he makes, particularly to Cora and security, will showcase his leadership and commitment to the new timeline's protocols.
Developing Craig's Role
I'm now integrating Craig's responses throughout the crisis. I'm focusing on his initial shock, followed by his immediate activation of the new protocols. I'm refining how his leadership manifests through decisive phone calls and unwavering support for his players. His understanding of the situation is paramount.
Defining the Response
I'm now zeroing in on Craig's actions after seeing the unfolding drama on TV. The high score's importance is apparent. I'm focusing on his quick communication with Cora and Red Sox security. The contrast of the team's decisive response, facilitated by his prior effort, against the backdrop of a seemingly routine win further highlights his effectiveness.
The television in my office was on, as it always was during games, but the sound was low. It was background noise, a comforting rhythm to my evening paperwork. April 27th, 2025. A Saturday. We were in Cleveland, playing the series finale. The new timeline was beautiful. We had won the pennant in ’24. Duran was healthy and happy. Devers, after a long and respectful offseason conversation, had embraced his role as a leader and primary DH, welcoming Bregman as a key piece to a championship puzzle. Pivetta, not Buehler, was our big pitching signing, and he was dealing.
The game was a laugher. 13-3 in the top of the seventh. I was half-watching, half-smiling. This was the team I had envisioned. Powerful, deep, and mentally sound.
Duran was at the plate. He flew out to center field. A routine play. He peeled off toward our dugout on the first-base side, his head down in minor, competitive frustration.
And then I saw it.
It wasn’t a sound I heard. It was a motion. A sudden, violent stillness. He stopped dead in his tracks on the grass, halfway to the dugout. His head snapped to the side, toward the stands just past first base. The camera, following him, caught the instantaneous shift in his entire being. The casual trot of a professional athlete became the rigid, coiled posture of a man who had just been struck.
My blood ran cold. The pen fell from my hand and clattered onto the desk.
“No,” I whispered to the empty room. “Not again. It can’t be.”
On the screen, I saw Alex Cora pop out of the dugout, his eyes locked on Duran. He knew. He had been trained for this. In the on-deck circle, Alex Bregman straightened up, his practice swings forgotten, and took a step toward Duran.
The broadcast team was confused. “Duran seems to have stopped… taking exception to something a fan has said,” Will Flemming narrated, his voice cautious. “You can see Alex Cora is already on his way out…”
But before Cora could get there, the new timeline asserted itself.
Duran didn’t scream. He didn’t curse. He took one step toward the stands, his face a mask of cold, controlled fury, and then he stopped himself. He turned, his eyes searching, and found the first base umpire. He pointed. He was talking, his gestures sharp, precise. He was reporting it. He was using the system. He was asking for help.
And then the cavalry arrived.
It wasn’t a charge. It was a formation. A living wall. Bregman was there first, putting a hand on Duran’s shoulder, his body physically shielding him from the stands. Devers was right behind him, his face grim, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Bregman. They were a united front. Then came Rafaela, his young face a mirror of fierce loyalty, standing just behind Jarren, a silent guard. The dugout had emptied. Not with aggression, but with a quiet, unshakeable solidarity. They surrounded their brother.
My hand, trembling, reached for the phone. But I paused. I watched as the home plate umpire strode toward the section Duran had indicated. He didn’t hesitate. He didn’t wait for the half-inning. He stopped the game. He pointed into the crowd, and stadium security, already moving, converged.
This was it. This was the proof. All the meetings, the new protocols, the conversations with the league about player safety—it was working.
I dialed Cora’s number.
“Get him out of there, Alex,” I said, my voice low and tight. “Get him in the clubhouse. Now.”
“Already on it, Craig,” Cora’s voice came back, strained but steady. “The team’s got him.”
I hung up and immediately dialed our head of security. “I don’t care that we’re in Cleveland. I want a name. I want a police report. I want his picture sent to every security head in the league. He is banned from Fenway for life before his mugshot is even processed. Make it happen.”
I didn’t wait for a reply. I hung up and stood, pacing the office, my heart a wild drum against my ribs. I watched the television as security escorted a man, red-faced and belligerent, from the stands. The fans around him were pointing, helping, their faces etched with disgust. The hate was an island, drowned in a sea of decency.
The team enveloped Duran, guiding him back to the dugout, a phalanx of protection. He was hidden from the cameras, swallowed by his teammates.
The game eventually resumed. But I wasn’t watching anymore. I was thinking about the aftermath. About the man, not the player.
An hour later, my phone buzzed. It was a text from Alex Cora.
He’s okay. Shaken. We’re with him in my office. The guys have been rotating in and out. Raffy, Bregman, Pivetta. They’re not letting him be alone. He cried. I think that’s a good thing this time. He’s not fighting it. He’s letting us help carry it.
I sank into my chair, the tension leaving my body in a single, shuddering wave. I read the text again. He’s letting us help carry it.
I thought of the woman, of her story of a lonely robot protecting a galaxy. She was wrong. He wasn’t alone anymore.
My own phone buzzed again. I looked down. It was a text from a number I didn’t recognize, but I knew who it was from. It was from Devers.
Craig. We got him. He’s our brother. Don’t worry.
I leaned back and closed my eyes, the image of that human wall on the field burning bright behind them. The burden was immense. But tonight, for the first time, I knew with absolute certainty that I wasn't the only one carrying it.
<May 2nd, 2025, series opener at Fenway against twins. Bello pitching. Top 2, Duran dived for a line drive. He caught it before landed on the warning track in foul territory. His left hand grinded on the hard ground. When he stood up, his palm and forearm was covered with something red. Everyone thought it was the red dirt, but Breslow knew it was blood.> <imagine the scene of pulling Duran and Casas off the field> <add more details> <Stop the scene there. Later I'll provide you with more details for what happened in the trainer's room>
The air in my office was cool and still, a stark contrast to the electric buzz of a Friday night at Fenway. It was May 2nd, the series opener against the Twins. Bello was on the mound, dealing. The game was scoreless in the top of the second inning.
I was on my feet, pacing behind my desk, a nervous energy I couldn’t shake. My calendar was clear. My focus was entirely on the television. I knew this date. I knew this game. I knew the precursor.
A Twins batter ripped a line drive down the left-field line. It was hooking foul, a tough play. Jarren Duran, his motor always running hot, took off at a dead sprint. He laid out, a full-extension dive, his body parallel to the ground. He snagged the ball just before it hit the warning track, his gloved hand cradling the out.
The crowd roared. It was a spectacular, highlight-reel catch.
But I wasn’t watching the ball. I was watching his left hand.
As he pushed himself up, his bare hand scraped against the coarse dirt of the warning track. He stood, pumped his fist, and jogged back toward his position. The camera zoomed in on him, celebrating the play. And there it was.
A dark, crimson smear coated the pinky side of his palm, streaking up his forearm. To the announcers, to the 37,000 fans, it looked like the rust-colored clay of the track.
But I knew better.
“That’s it,” I whispered, my voice tight. “That’s the signal.”
My hand was already on the phone, my thumb hovering over Alex Cora’s name. I took one last look at the field. Triston Casas was taking his lead off first base, pounding his glove, ready for the next batter.
I pressed the call button.
“Craig?” Cora’s voice was upbeat, energized by the play.
“Alex,” I said, my voice a calm, cold blade that cut through the noise. “Protocol. Now.”
There was a beat of silence. He knew exactly what I meant. We had rehearsed this.
“Duran and Casas,” I stated, leaving no room for discussion. “They’re both out of the game. Effective immediately.”
“Duran just made the catch of the year, Craig,” he protested, a reflex. “He’s fine, he’s waving…”
“I don’t care, Alex,” I cut him off, my tone absolute. “He’s bleeding. He comes out. And Casas comes out with him. That is not a request. Pull them both. I want Refsnyder in left and Toro at first. Do it now.”
I hung up. I didn’t need to watch the argument. I needed to watch the execution.
On the screen, I saw Cora turn from the phone, his face set with grim resolve. He barked an order into the dugout. Rob Refsnyder and Abraham Toro immediately grabbed their gloves.
Cora walked out of the dugout, not toward the mound, but toward left field. The head trainer, Brandon Schneider, was right with him. Simultaneously, the bench coach walked down to first base.
The crowd murmured, confused. The broadcast team was baffled.
“Well, this is highly unusual,” Don Orsillo said from the booth. “Alex Cora and the trainer are heading out to left field after that spectacular catch by Duran. And it looks like… yes, they’re pulling him from the game.”
Duran saw them coming and started shaking his head, a look of pure disbelief on his face. He held up his hand, showing them the scrape. “It’s just a scratch!” he yelled, his voice lost to the broadcast but his body language screaming his protest.
Cora didn’t engage. He just pointed to the dugout. “You’re done. Go see Schneid.”
Meanwhile, at first base, the bench coach was having a quiet word with Triston Casas. Casas looked up, his expression one of complete bewilderment. He pointed at his knee, at his legs, as if to say, ‘I’m fine.’ The coach just shook his head and pointed to the dugout.
“And Triston Casas is being removed as well,” Orsillo exclaimed, his voice full of shock. “I have no idea what’s happening here. Two players pulled from the game in the middle of an inning with no apparent injuries. This is one of the strangest things I’ve seen.”
I watched as Duran, his face a thundercloud of fury, jogged toward the dugout, refusing to look at Cora. Casas, looking more confused than angry, trotted off the field, shaking his head.
They disappeared down the tunnel.
I let out a long, slow breath. The fires were contained. The prophecies were averted. The cost was a confused clubhouse, an angry star, and a baffled fanbase.
I would take that trade every single day of the week.
I leaned back in my chair, my work in the office done. Now, the real work began. I stood up, grabbed my keys, and headed for the door. It was time to walk down to the trainer’s room and face the storm I had created.
<Jarren remained still when the wound is cleaned. His right hand gripped the edge of the chair until his knuckles turned white. A thin layer of sweat broke on his forehead> 
<As the mud was removed and the wound was exposed, everyone took a sharp breath>
<add more details.>
<stop the scene here. >
The walk from my office to the clubhouse level was one I’d made a thousand times, but this time it felt different. Every step was heavy with the weight of my decision. I could hear the low murmur of the crowd through the concrete walls, a distant, muffled roar that felt like it was from another world.
I pushed through the door into the trainer’s room. The air was thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic and athletic tape. The scene was exactly as I had pictured it, a tableau of controlled chaos.
Triston Casas was sitting on a training table, looking utterly bewildered. He was talking to a junior trainer, pointing at his perfectly healthy knee. “I’m telling you, man, I feel great. I don’t get it.”
My focus, however, was on the far corner of the room.
Jarren Duran was seated in a chair, his back to the door. He was shirtless, his athletic frame tense. Head trainer Brandon Schneider was kneeling in front of him, a basin of warm water and a stack of sterile gauze on a small table nearby. Jarren’s left arm was extended, his hand resting over the basin.
He was perfectly still. His posture was rigid, a statue carved from granite. The only signs of the war being waged within him were the ones you had to look for. His right hand was clamped onto the metal edge of the chair, his knuckles stark white against the chrome. A thin sheen of sweat glistened on his forehead under the harsh fluorescent lights, despite the cool air. He was staring at a spot on the far wall, his jaw so tight I could see the muscle flexing from across the room.
He was enduring. He was proving he could take it.
“Alright, Jarren,” Schneider’s voice was calm, professional. “Let’s get this cleaned up so we can see what we’re dealing with. This might sting a bit.”
Jarren just gave a short, sharp nod, his eyes never leaving the wall.
Schneider dipped a piece of gauze into the water and began to gently wipe away the mixture of dirt, clay, and blood from Jarren’s palm. It was a slow, meticulous process. With each wipe, more of the red warning track clay came away.
And with each wipe, more of the angry, raw red of his skin was revealed.
I moved closer, standing near the doorway, a silent observer. Casas saw me and opened his mouth to speak, but I held up a hand, my eyes fixed on Jarren.
Schneider worked with practiced efficiency, his movements gentle but firm. He was talking, a low, steady monologue meant to distract and soothe. “Yeah, that warning track’s got some bite to it. Saw a guy catch a spike on it back in ’19, opened up his whole shin…”
He peeled away the last layer of grime from the center of the wound.
And then he stopped.
The room fell silent. The low murmur of the game on the TV in the corner seemed to fade away. Even Casas stopped talking.
Everyone in the room took a sharp, involuntary breath.
It wasn’t a scrape. It wasn’t a simple abrasion. The warning track hadn’t just skinned his palm. It had acted like a belt sander. A large patch of skin, from the base of his pinky to the fleshy part of his palm, was simply gone. It was a raw, weeping, angry red, dotted with embedded grit. It was the kind of wound that made you physically recoil, the kind that screamed with a pain that was almost visible.
Schneider, the consummate professional, recovered first. But I saw the flicker in his eyes.
“Okay,” he said, his voice a little tighter than before. “Okay. That’s a little deeper than we thought.”
Jarren didn’t move. He didn’t flinch. He just kept staring at the wall, his knuckles turning from white to a pale, bloodless grey. But I saw his shoulders tense, a single, minute tremor of agony that he couldn’t suppress.
He was still trying to prove he could take it. And looking at that hand, I knew with a certainty that chilled me to the bone that if we had let him, he would have tried to swing a bat with it.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. > <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> 
<imagine everyone’s reaction>
<add more details>
<stop the scene here. >
The collective intake of breath was sharp, a sound of shared, visceral shock. The junior trainer who had been talking to Casas let out a low, involuntary, “Jeez.” Casas himself leaned forward, his own confusion forgotten, his face paling as he got a clear look at the injury. “Oh, man… JD…” he murmured, his voice trailing off.
My own stomach lurched. From across the room, I had known it was bad. Up close, it was grotesque. It wasn’t a baseball injury. It looked like something from a machine shop accident, a burn victim. The top layers of skin weren’t just scraped away; they were obliterated. The exposed tissue beneath was a horrifying mosaic of pink and deep red, glistening under the sterile lights. It was raw, elemental. It was the anatomy of pain laid bare for all to see.
Brandon Schneider’s professionalism was a rock in the suddenly silent room. He exhaled slowly, his mind shifting from a simple cleaning to a much more serious medical situation. “Alright,” he said, his voice calm but carrying a new weight of authority. “Change of plans. We need to irrigate this. Thoroughly. There’s a lot of foreign matter in there.”
He looked up at his assistant. “Get me a sterile saline flush, a full liter. And grab the lidocaine gel. We’re going to need to numb this before we debride it. Call Dr. Adams, tell him I’m sending him pictures and that we may need a consult on a skin graft if this doesn’t granulate properly.”
Skin graft. The words hung in the air, heavy and terrifying.
Jarren’s reaction was the most chilling of all. He didn’t react. His eyes remained locked on that spot on the far wall. The sweat on his brow was more pronounced now, trickling down his temples. His jaw was a knot of solid muscle. He was no longer just enduring; he was dissociating. He was mentally abandoning his own body, retreating to the one place the pain couldn’t reach him. He was back in the park, a small boy running home, forcing himself to turn around and face the man with the baseballs.
I saw it then. The true depth of his conditioning. He wasn’t just hiding the pain from us. He was trying to hide it from himself.
I walked forward, my footsteps echoing in the quiet room. I stopped beside Schneider, looking down at the mangled hand.
“Brandon,” I said, my voice low and steady, pitched only for him and Jarren to hear. “Forget the gel for a second. Can you give us the room?”
Schneider looked up at me, surprised. “Craig, I need to treat this. The risk of infection is…”
“I know,” I interrupted, my voice gentle but firm. “And you will. In five minutes. But right now, I need the room. Please.”
Schneider held my gaze for a long moment, saw the absolute conviction there, and gave a slow, reluctant nod. He stood up. “Alright. Everybody out. Give us some space.”
The other trainers and Casas filed out, casting worried glances back at Jarren. The door clicked shut, leaving just the three of us in the stark, silent room.
I pulled up a rolling stool and sat down, not in front of Jarren, but beside him. I didn’t look at his hand. I looked at his face. At the rigid line of his jaw, the sweat on his skin, the distant, haunted look in his eyes.
I didn’t speak. I just sat there with him, in the silence, sharing the space. I wasn’t his GM. I wasn’t his boss. I was just another person in the room, bearing witness to his pain. For a full minute, the only sound was the hum of the ice machine and the ragged, controlled rhythm of his breathing. He was fighting a war, and for the first time, I was sitting in the trench with him, whether he wanted me there or not.
<imagine the conversation>
The silence stretched, thick and heavy. I didn’t break it. I let it be his. The battle he was fighting was internal, and the first step was to respect its borders. I just sat beside him, a quiet presence, letting him know he wasn’t alone in the room.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, his eyes flickered away from the spot on the wall and glanced at me, just for a second. It was a crack in the armor. A silent acknowledgment of my presence.
“Craig,” I said, my voice soft, barely above a whisper. I still wasn’t looking at the wound. I was looking at his face. “I’m not going to tell you that doesn’t hurt. We both know that’s a lie.”
He didn’t respond. His gaze went back to the wall, but his jaw seemed a fraction less tight.
“I want to tell you why I pulled you from the game,” I continued, my tone even, conversational. “And why I pulled Triston.”
I paused, giving him a chance to tell me to shut up. He didn’t.
“It had nothing to do with that catch. That was one of the best catches I’ve seen all year. It was incredible.” I let the praise land, sincere and specific. “It also had nothing to do with your hand. Not really. I pulled you because I made a promise to myself, and to this organization, that we were going to start being smarter than we are tough.”
I saw his eyes flicker toward me again.
“Your toughness is a given, Jarren. It’s your superpower. It’s why you’re here. Nobody in this room, or in this city, doubts it. But my job is to protect that superpower, not exploit it. My job is to make sure you’re able to use it in October, not burn it out in May.”
I leaned forward slightly, resting my forearms on my knees, mirroring his posture. “I pulled Triston because I want to send a message to that entire clubhouse. And the message is this: The health of this team is not up for negotiation. It’s not a democracy. We are going to make the smart decision, the safe decision, every single time. Even if it feels weird. Even if it makes us angry in the moment. We protect our guys. Period.”
I finally glanced down at his mangled hand, then immediately looked back at his face.
“This,” I said, my voice dropping even lower, full of a quiet intensity. “This is why. Because I know you. I know you would have tried to play with this. You would have wrapped it up, taken a handful of Advil, and told everyone you were fine. And you would have gotten a hit. I have no doubt. And in doing so, you would have risked infection, you would have altered your swing, and you would have been in agony for three weeks. We would have lost the best version of you because we were too scared to make you sit for a few days.”
I looked him straight in the eye. “That’s not toughness. That’s a bad trade. And I’m not making any more bad trades with the health of my players.”
He finally turned his head and looked at me fully. His eyes were dark, swimming with a universe of pain and confusion and a flicker of something else. Understanding.
“It’s just a scrape,” he mumbled, the words a reflex, a line from a script he’d been reciting his whole life.
“No, it’s not,” I said gently, but with absolute firmness. “It’s a significant injury that needs to be treated properly. And we’re going to treat it. You’re going on the Injured List. Ten days. Maybe fifteen. You’re not going to swing a bat until Brandon and Dr. Adams tell me that wound is closed and the risk of infection is zero. And you’re not going to argue with me about it.”
I held his gaze. “Because this isn’t a punishment. This is the plan. This is how we keep you on the field for 15 years. This is how we win a championship. Not by being the toughest team, but by being the smartest and the healthiest.”
I stood up. “I’m going to go get Brandon. He needs to do his work. Your only job right now is to sit in this chair and let him. Your job is to heal. The team will handle the rest.”
I put a hand on his shoulder, the one on his uninjured side. I gave it a firm, steady squeeze.
“I’ve got your back, Jarren,” I said softly. “Always.”
He just looked at me, and for the first time, I saw the rigid wall of the warrior begin to crumble, replaced by the weary, vulnerable face of a young man who was finally being given permission to hurt. He gave a single, almost imperceptible nod.
<It was a deep abrasion on the pinky side of Jarren’s left palm. A third of the area of the palm. > <The skin completely disappeared. The tissue below the skin was exposed.> 
<the treatment includes three parts: cleaning, debridement, antiseptic>
<imagine everyone’s reaction>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before treatment starts>
The collective intake of breath hung in the sterile air, a shared moment of visceral shock. The wound, now fully exposed under the unforgiving fluorescent lights, was far worse than a simple scrape. It was a violation. A third of his palm was a raw, glistening landscape of exposed subcutaneous tissue, a grotesque geography of pink and deep red, stippled with the dark grit the warning track had ground into him. The skin wasn't just broken; it was gone. Erased.
Brandon Schneider, his face now a grim mask of professional focus, stood up. “Okay,” he said, his voice leaving no room for argument. “New plan.” He looked at his assistant. “Get me the deep debridement kit. Saline wash, forceps, surgical scissors, the works. And lidocaine.”
The assistant, a young intern whose face had gone pale, nodded quickly and hurried to a supply cabinet.
I watched Jarren. He hadn’t moved. He hadn’t looked down. His eyes were still locked on that spot on the far wall, but a single bead of sweat broke from his hairline and traced a path down his temple. His stillness was no longer a sign of toughness; it was a sign of shock, a man holding himself together by a single, fraying thread of will.
Triston Casas, all his confusion forgotten, slid off his training table and took a tentative step closer. He was a big man, but he looked like a kid peering at something awful and fascinating. “Oh, man,” he breathed, his voice a low whisper of sympathetic horror. “JD… dude, that’s… gnarly.”
Jarren didn’t respond. He didn’t even blink.
I walked further into the room, my footsteps echoing on the linoleum floor. I stopped beside Casas, my eyes fixed on the mangled hand. The sight of it sent a cold spike of fury through me—fury at myself for the brief moment I had considered letting him stay in the game, fury at the universe for its casual cruelty.
“What’s the procedure, Schneid?” I asked, my voice low and steady, cutting through the tension.
Schneider turned to me, his expression all business. “It’s a full-thickness abrasion, Craig. All layers of the epidermis and dermis are gone. First, we have to irrigate it. Flush out all that embedded debris. That’s going to be… unpleasant.” He glanced at Jarren’s rigid form. “Then, debridement. I have to go in with forceps and scissors and manually remove any dead tissue and any foreign material that the saline doesn’t get. We can’t have anything left in there, or the infection risk is massive.”
He took a deep breath. “After it’s completely clean, we’ll hit it with antiseptic, apply a non-adherent dressing, and wrap it. He’s not touching a bat or a ball for at least ten days. Minimum. And that’s if it doesn’t get infected.”
The young assistant returned with a stainless-steel tray. On it was a formidable array of instruments that looked like they belonged in an operating room, not a clubhouse trainer’s room. The sight of the fine-tipped forceps and the sharp, curved scissors made the reality of the situation brutally clear.
I looked at Jarren. At his white-knuckled grip on the chair. At the sweat on his brow. He was about to endure a procedure that would be excruciating, and he was preparing to do it the only way he knew how: by suffering in silence.
I knew, in that moment, that I couldn’t let that happen. The culture change I had envisioned couldn’t just be about days off and proactive rests. It had to be about this. The moments of acute pain.
I walked over and stood in his line of sight, forcing him to break his stare at the wall and look at me. His eyes were dark, deep pools of controlled agony.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice quiet but firm. “Look at me.”
He blinked, his focus slowly shifting to my face.
“You are not going to sit there and just take this,” I said. “This isn’t a test. There is no trophy for enduring this without making a sound. Schneider is going to numb the area as best he can, but this is going to hurt. A lot. And you are allowed to say so. You are allowed to yell. You are allowed to curse out everyone in this room. You are allowed to tell him to stop if you need a minute. Do you understand me?”
I held his gaze, trying to pour all the conviction and sincerity I possessed into my eyes.
“Your toughness is not in question here,” I continued, my voice softening slightly. “It’s the reason you’re in this room. But your only job for the next twenty minutes is to get through this. That’s it. There is no other test. There is no other expectation.”
He stared at me, his expression unreadable. A dozen different emotions flickered in his eyes—confusion, anger, pain, and something else… a flicker of surprise, of disbelief.
Schneider stepped forward, a syringe in his hand. “Ready, Craig.”
I didn’t move. I kept my eyes locked on Jarren’s.
“We’ve got you,” I said softly. “Just let us help.”
<Jarren remained still and silent in the cleaning process>
<His whole body was rigid>
<Tendons on his forearm stood out>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before debridement>
Schneider nodded, his face a mask of grim professionalism. “Alright, Jarren. First, we flush. This is just sterile saline. It’s going to be cold, and the pressure might be uncomfortable.”
He aimed the nozzle of a large syringe filled with saline at the raw wound. Jarren’s only response was a slight, almost imperceptible tightening of his jaw.
The first stream of saline hit the exposed tissue.
Jarren’s entire body went rigid, a single, solid block of granite. A low, guttural sound, more a strangled grunt than a groan, escaped his lips before he clamped his mouth shut. His eyes, which had been fixed on mine, squeezed shut. The tendons on his uninjured forearm, the one gripping the chair, stood out like steel cables, straining against his skin. His knuckles, already pale, seemed to lose all color entirely.
Schneider worked methodically, his movements efficient and precise, flushing the wound from different angles. With each pulse of saline, a fresh wave of tremors wracked Jarren’s body. He didn’t make another sound, but the violence of his silent struggle was terrifying to watch. His breathing was shallow, coming in sharp, controlled hisses through his clenched teeth. The sweat on his forehead was no longer a sheen; it was beading, dripping down his temples and onto the floor.
I stood my ground, my eyes locked on his face, trying to project a sense of calm I did not feel. I felt utterly useless. My words of permission, of support, seemed like hollow, meaningless platitudes in the face of such raw, physical agony. He wasn’t listening to me. He was somewhere else, somewhere deep inside himself, locked in a familiar battle with a familiar foe: pain. He was back in the park with his father, refusing to cry, refusing to run.
Casas, who had been watching from a distance, turned away. He couldn’t watch anymore. He walked over to the other side of the room and leaned against a wall, his own face pale.
The irrigation seemed to last an eternity. When Schneider finally set the syringe down, the basin was filled with pinkish water and dark specks of debris. The wound itself looked cleaner, but somehow angrier, more inflamed. The raw tissue seemed to throb under the harsh lights.
“Okay,” Schneider said, his voice low. “Irrigation is done. Now for the lidocaine. This will help, Jarren, but the injections are going to sting.”
He prepped a small needle. Jarren’s eyes, which had been squeezed shut, opened again. They were glassy, unfocused, staring through me rather than at me. He gave a single, jerky nod.
Schneider administered a series of small injections around the perimeter of the wound. With each needle prick, Jarren’s body jerked, a marionette whose strings were being pulled by jolts of pure agony. But still, he made no sound beyond the sharp hiss of his breathing. He was a fortress under siege, and he was refusing to surrender.
After the final injection, Schneider set the needle down and gave the anesthetic a moment to work.
“Alright,” he said, his voice heavy. He picked up the stainless-steel tray with the forceps and scissors. The metallic click as he set it down next to the chair was unnervingly loud in the tense silence.
“The area should be numb now,” Schneider said, though his tone suggested he knew better. “But you’re still going to feel pressure. A lot of it.”
He picked up the fine-tipped forceps, the steel glinting under the lights.
“Debridement starts now,” he announced to the room.
He leaned in, his focus absolute, and touched the forceps to the edge of the mangled tissue.
Jarren’s eyes squeezed shut again. His entire body braced for the next wave of the assault. The battle was about to enter its most brutal phase.
<the debridement started with forceps>
<Jarren’s whole body was shaking and almost curled into fetal position. > 
<Jarren panicked when trainer picked up the scalpel for deeper particels. He used defiance to disguise his panic. He told the trainer ‘It’s clean. Stop it.’>
<add more details>
<stop the scene there. I’ll provide you with more details about the debridement with scalpel>
The first touch of the cold steel forceps on the raw tissue was like a lit match to a fuse.
Jarren’s carefully constructed fortress of silence shattered. A choked, agonized sound ripped from his throat, a sound of pure, animal pain. His entire body convulsed. His back arched off the chair, and his legs kicked out, as if trying to flee a predator that had him in its jaws. The hand gripping the chair slipped, his sweat-slicked palm losing its purchase. He instinctively tried to curl inward, to protect the source of the agony, his body contorting into a near-fetal position even as he remained seated.
Schneider pulled back instantly. “Easy, Jarren, easy,” he said, his voice a low, steady anchor in the storm of pain. “Breathe. Just breathe.”
Jarren’s chest was heaving, his breaths coming in ragged, desperate gasps. He was shaking uncontrollably now, the tremors running through him in violent, unrelenting waves. The sweat was pouring off him, soaking his hair and the waistband of his shorts.
“I… I can’t,” he gasped, the words forced out between clenched teeth.
“Yes, you can,” I said, my voice firm but calm. I moved closer, kneeling down so I was at his eye level. I didn’t touch him. I just made him see me. “We’re right here. Schneider has to do this. We have to get it clean. Look at me. Breathe with me. In… and out.”
I exaggerated my own breathing, trying to give him a rhythm to latch onto. His wild, pain-filled eyes found mine. He tried to follow, his own breathing still ragged but less frantic.
Schneider, seeing his chance, leaned in again. “Just a little bit at a time, JD. I’m just getting the loose stuff.”
He worked with a surgeon’s precision, his movements quick and deliberate. With each pluck of the forceps, a fresh jolt of agony shot through Jarren. He flinched, he groaned, he cursed under his breath, but he held on, his eyes locked on mine, his entire being focused on the simple act of breathing.
After what felt like an hour but was probably only five minutes, Schneider set the forceps down. “Okay,” he said, wiping his own brow. “Most of the surface debris is gone. But there are still some deeper particles in there. The forceps can’t get them. I need to use the scalpel to scrape them out.”
He reached for the tray and picked up a small, sterile scalpel. The blade was tiny, but under the fluorescent lights, it looked like a sword.
The sight of it broke through Jarren’s fragile trance. His eyes widened, a new emotion flooding them, overriding the pain: pure, stark panic.
“No,” he said, his voice suddenly sharp, defiant. He pulled his hand back from Schneider’s reach, cradling it against his chest. “No. It’s clean. It’s good enough. Stop it.”
He wasn’t looking at me anymore. He was looking at the scalpel, his breathing becoming shallow and rapid again. This was a new kind of fear. The forceps were one thing; the idea of a blade deliberately scraping at his raw, living tissue was another. It was a violation his mind, already battered by pain, refused to accept.
“It’s clean,” he repeated, his voice rising, a desperate edge of defiance creeping in. It was the only defense mechanism he had left. “I said, stop. We’re done.”
Schneider looked at me, his expression a mixture of frustration and helplessness. The procedure had hit a wall. A wall of fear.
<Craig and Triston coaxed Jarren to accept the scalpel>
<some tissues had to be cut. Some particles are buried so deep that trained had to make a cut on the tissue to get the particle out>
<Jarren endured many cuts, but finally got enough>
<Jarren pulled his hand back. The combined force of Triston and Craig couldn’t pull his hand out>
<The fear is about not wanting to break down. Not wanting other people to see he’s hurt>
<add more details>
<Stop the scene here>
I remained kneeling, my eyes locked on Jarren’s. I saw the panic, but underneath it, I saw the familiar terror: the fear of being seen as weak, the fear of breaking down. The defiance was a shield, a flimsy piece of armor against a new wave of agony he didn’t think he could endure without shattering completely.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice low and calm, refusing to engage with his defiance. “It’s not clean. Not yet. Schneider has to get those last pieces out. If he doesn’t, it gets infected. And an infection means surgeries, it means IV antibiotics, it means you could lose months of the season. We can’t risk that.”
“I don’t care,” he shot back, his voice tight with panic. “It’s fine. I’ll take the risk.”
From across the room, Triston Casas moved. He walked over slowly, his usual easygoing demeanor replaced by a quiet, serious empathy. He didn’t address Jarren’s defiance. He spoke to the man.
“JD,” Casas said, his voice a soft rumble. “Hey, man. Look at me.”
Jarren’s panicked eyes flickered toward his teammate.
“I get it,” Casas said, nodding toward the scalpel. “That thing looks medieval. But Schneid’s right. You gotta let him finish. We need you out there, man. We can’t have you laid up for half the year because of some stupid piece of dirt. Just… let him do it. We’re right here. We’re not going anywhere.”
He wasn’t coaxing a player. He was talking to his friend. It was a simple, honest plea, grounded in their shared purpose.
I saw the shield in Jarren’s eyes crack, just a little. The defiance wavered, replaced by a raw, desperate vulnerability. He looked from Casas’s earnest face back to mine.
“It’s the last step,” I said softly. “Then it’s over. We’ll get through this part, and then it’s just healing. Let us help you get there.”
He stared at me for a long, silent moment, his chest rising and falling with ragged breaths. Finally, with a look of utter resignation, of a man walking to his own execution, he gave a single, jerky nod. He slowly, reluctantly, extended his hand back toward Schneider.
“Okay,” Schneider said, his voice gentle. “Thank you, Jarren. I’ll be as quick as I can.”
He picked up the scalpel. The next few minutes were a descent into a new circle of hell. Schneider had to scrape, to press, to meticulously pick at particles buried deep in the tissue. Then came the worst part. He found a piece of gravel embedded so deeply that scraping wasn’t enough.
“I have to make a small incision to get this one out, Jarren,” Schneider said, his voice heavy with apology. “I’m sorry.”
The first cut of the blade into the already traumatized flesh was too much.
A raw, guttural scream tore from Jarren’s throat, a sound of such profound agony that it seemed to shake the very walls of the room. His body convulsed, a violent, full-body tremor. He endured it. He endured a second cut, and a third, each one accompanied by a choked-off cry of pain. His face was pale, streaked with tears he wasn’t aware he was crying.
But after the fourth cut, something inside him snapped.
“NO!” he roared, the word a primal rejection of the pain, of the situation, of his own inability to control it. He ripped his hand back with a surge of adrenaline-fueled strength, cradling it to his chest like a wounded animal. “NO MORE! I’M DONE!”
Schneider, startled, reached for his hand. “Jarren, I’m almost finished, I just need…”
“GET OFF ME!” Jarren screamed, scrambling back in his chair, his eyes wild with a cornered animal’s terror.
I moved instantly, putting my hand gently on his shoulder. “Jarren, it’s okay, just…”
He flinched away from my touch as if he’d been burned. Casas, seeing the situation escalating, moved to his other side, putting a large, steadying hand on his other arm. “Whoa, JD, easy man, easy…”
But it was no use. Jarren was lost in the panic. He was fighting us, fighting the pain, fighting the fear of completely breaking down in front of us. He was a knot of pure, terrified strength. The combined, gentle pressure from me and a man as big as Triston Casas was nothing against his desperate, absolute refusal. His hand was locked against his chest, and he wasn’t letting go.
He had reached his limit. The fortress had been breached, and his only instinct was to retreat, to hide the damage, to not let anyone see how hurt he truly was.
<Cora went in to hold Jarren's head to his chest, like a father>
<Triston held Jarren's left arm>
<Craig held Jarren from falling off the chair and rubbed his back>
<the debridement went on for a brutally long time>
<add more details.>
<stop the scene here, before antiseptic>
The door to the trainer’s room swung open. Alex Cora stood there, his face a grim, thunderous mask. He had clearly heard the screaming from his office down the hall. He took in the scene in a single, sweeping glance: Jarren, cornered and terrified; me and Casas, trying and failing to contain him; Schneider, standing helpless with the scalpel in his hand.
Cora didn’t hesitate. He didn’t speak. He moved with a quiet, absolute authority that changed the entire gravity of the room.
He walked directly to Jarren, bypassing all of us. He knelt down in front of the chair, putting himself below Jarren’s eye level. He didn’t reach for the injured hand. He reached for the man.
“Mírame, mijo,” Cora said, his voice a low, soft command. Look at me, son.
Jarren’s wild, panicked eyes, which had been darting around the room, finally locked onto his manager’s.
“It’s okay,” Cora whispered in Spanish, his voice a soothing balm. “It’s okay to be scared. It’s okay that it hurts. But you have to let him finish. We have to get this done.” He opened his arms. “Ven aquí.” Come here.
And then, Jarren broke.
The defiance, the anger, the terror—it all crumbled at once, washed away by that simple, paternal command. A raw, ragged sob tore from his chest, the sound of a pain far deeper than any physical wound. He collapsed forward, burying his face in the crook of Cora’s neck, his shoulders shaking with violent, unrestrained sobs. Cora wrapped his arms around him, holding his head firmly against his chest, rocking him gently like a father comforting a child after a nightmare.
“Shhh, I got you,” Cora murmured, his hand stroking the back of Jarren’s sweat-soaked hair. “I got you. You’re not alone. We’re right here.”
The room was silent, save for the sound of Jarren’s weeping. It was a sacred, terrible sound.
Casas, his own eyes wet, looked at me, then at Jarren’s left arm, still clutched to his chest. He understood. He moved in, his touch now infinitely gentle, and took hold of Jarren’s upper arm. He wasn’t restraining him; he was supporting him, a silent, steady presence.
I moved behind the chair, placing a hand firmly on Jarren’s back, rubbing slow, steady circles, grounding him. My other hand rested on his shoulder, preventing him from collapsing entirely. We had become a human shield, a living brace, holding him together while he fell apart.
Over Jarren’s shaking shoulders, Cora’s eyes met Schneider’s. He gave a single, sharp nod. Finish it.
Schneider stepped forward, his face etched with a grim, compassionate resolve. And the debridement began again.
It was brutally, agonizingly long. Jarren’s sobs never stopped, muffled against Cora’s shoulder. His body still flinched and jerked with every scrape of the blade, but he no longer fought it. He surrendered to the pain, and to the support surrounding him. He let us hold the weight.
Schneider worked with a relentless focus, his hands moving with a terrible grace. He scraped. He cut. He tweezed. He was a craftsman working on a ruined canvas, meticulously removing every last speck of impurity. Each movement was a fresh wave of agony for Jarren, a fresh tremor that ran through his body and into ours. I could feel his shudders through my hand on his back, a direct transmission of his suffering.
Time ceased to have meaning. There was only the scraping of steel on flesh, the sound of a grown man’s weeping, and the steady, rhythmic murmur of Alex Cora’s voice, whispering words of comfort in Spanish.
Finally, after an eternity, Schneider set the scalpel down on the tray with a soft, final click.
“It’s done,” he said, his voice hoarse with exhaustion. “It’s clean.”
The three of us remained in place, a human cocoon around the broken man in the chair, letting him cry until the storm inside him finally began to subside.
<Jarren didn’t even realize the debridement was over>
<but the antiseptic is coming.>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before the trainer mentioned antiseptic>
The final, metallic click of the scalpel hitting the tray echoed in the tense silence, but Jarren didn’t react. He was lost, adrift in a sea of pain and exhaustion, his body still trembling with the aftershocks of the ordeal. His sobs had subsided into a series of ragged, hitching breaths, his face still buried in the safety of Cora’s shoulder. He was a fighter who had finally been given permission to surrender, and he didn’t know how to come back from it.
Cora continued to hold him, his hand gently rubbing Jarren’s back, his murmurs now just soft, wordless sounds of comfort. He was giving him the space to just be. To be broken. To be held.
Casas’s grip on Jarren’s arm had softened from a brace to a steady, reassuring presence. He just stood there, a silent, loyal sentinel. My own hand continued its slow circles on his back, a constant, rhythmic reminder that he was not falling, that we were there.
Schneider, his face pale and beaded with sweat, quietly began to clean up the battlefield. He disposed of the bloodied gauze and the used instruments with a practiced efficiency that belied the emotional toll of the last half hour. He replaced the basin of pink water with a fresh one. He laid out a new, sterile set of supplies: a large, non-adherent dressing, rolls of gauze, and medical tape.
The room was a sanctuary of quiet empathy. The game on the television was a distant, irrelevant ghost. The only reality was here, in this small, sterile space, where a man’s armor had been stripped away, and his team had stepped in to become his shield.
I watched Jarren’s shoulders, feeling the tremors slowly, gradually, begin to lessen. His breathing started to even out, the ragged gasps softening into deep, weary sighs. He was slowly returning to himself, emerging from the depths.
After another long minute, he stirred. He shifted his weight, his hands pushing weakly against Cora’s chest. It wasn’t a rejection, but a slow, tentative re-emergence.
“Okay,” he mumbled, his voice thick and raw from crying. “Okay.”
Cora loosened his embrace, allowing Jarren to sit up. He didn’t let go completely, keeping a steadying hand on his shoulder. Jarren slowly lifted his head, his face pale, tear-streaked, and utterly exhausted. He looked like a soldier after a long and brutal battle. He wouldn’t meet anyone’s eyes, his gaze fixed on the floor.
Schneider, seeing his opening, moved back into position. He did it quietly, gently, his movements careful not to startle.
“You did great, Jarren,” Schneider said, his voice soft, full of a genuine, weary respect. “That was the hardest part. It’s over.”
He paused, giving Jarren a moment to process the words.
“We’re almost done,” Schneider continued, his tone calm and matter-of-fact. “Just one last step before we bandage you up.”
He reached for a small, brown bottle on the supply tray.
<If Jarren had any strength left, he would have fleed at the sight of antiseptic>
<He tried. He argued. He pleaded.>
<Cora, Triston and Craig prepared him for the antiseptic>
<If there were such thing as preparation in the face of purgatory>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before the antiseptic starts>
Schneider picked up the brown bottle, and the change in Jarren was instantaneous and profound.
The fragile calm he had found shattered. His head snapped up, his eyes, red-rimmed and swollen, widening with a fresh wave of pure, undiluted terror. He knew what that bottle was. He knew what was coming next.
“No,” he whispered, the word a dry, rasping plea. He started to scramble back in his chair, his movements clumsy with exhaustion and panic. “No, you said it was over. You said it was done.”
If he’d had any strength left, he would have bolted from the room. But his body was spent, his muscles trembling and weak from the prolonged agony. All he could do was try to shrink away, to make himself small, to pull his wounded hand back into the safety of his chest.
“I can’t,” he pleaded, his voice cracking, his gaze darting between the four of us like a trapped animal looking for an escape route. “Please. Just… just wrap it up. It’s clean. Please.”
This wasn’t the defiance from before. This was the desperate, heartbreaking plea of a man who had endured all he could endure and was now being told he had to walk back into the fire.
Cora tightened his grip on Jarren’s shoulder, holding him steady. “Mijo, listen to me. This is the last thing. The most important thing. This kills the germs. This stops the infection. We have to do this.”
“It’s gonna hurt,” Jarren choked out, tears welling in his eyes again. “I can’t… I can’t do it again.”
Casas, who had been a silent pillar, moved in again. He knelt down next to Cora, putting himself on Jarren’s level. “JD. Hey. We know. We know it’s gonna suck. But it’s fast. It’s like… ripping off a Band-Aid. A really, really big, terrible Band-Aid,” he said, a hint of his usual humor trying, and failing, to lighten the mood. His expression softened. “We’re not gonna lie to you, man. It’s gonna be hell for ten seconds. But then it’s over. For real this time. Ten seconds. We can do ten seconds.”
I moved to stand in front of him again, blocking his view of the terrifying brown bottle. I needed his focus.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice low and firm, cutting through his panic. “Look at me. Triston is right. It’s ten seconds. But in those ten seconds, you are not allowed to hold it in. You hear me? You scream. You curse. You squeeze Alex’s hand until you break it. You let it all out. That’s the only way we get through this. We absorb it. All of us.”
I looked at Cora, who nodded in understanding. He gently took Jarren’s right hand—his good hand—in his own. “Apriétame la mano,” he said softly. Squeeze my hand. “As hard as you need to.”
Jarren looked at the three of us, his chest heaving. He was being asked to willingly step off a cliff, armed only with the promise that we would be there at the bottom. There was no preparation for this. There was no way to brace for the liquid fire that was coming. There was only a shared breath, a grim acceptance, and the quiet before the storm.
Schneider stepped forward, a large piece of gauze in his hand. He uncapped the brown bottle. The sharp, chemical scent of iodine filled the air.
“Okay, Jarren,” Schneider said, his voice heavy with an apology he couldn’t speak. “On three.”
He soaked the gauze, the brown liquid staining it a deep, ominous color.
“One.”
Cora’s grip on Jarren’s hand tightened.
“Two.”
Casas put a steadying hand on Jarren’s knee. I kept my eyes locked on his.
“Three.”
<antiseptic brought excruciating agony above all>
<Jarren had never experienced anything like that>
<He used all his will to prevent himself from thrashing on the ground>
<At one point, he returned to that park in his childhood. He screamed“No! I’ll get a hit! I promise! No more! I be good! Daddy!”>
<add more details>
<Still more in the antiseptic process>
Schneider pressed the soaked gauze to the raw, open wound.
The world ended.
It was not a scream. It was a sound that had no place in a human throat. It was a raw, elemental shriek of pure, unadulterated agony that ripped through the room, through the concrete walls, a sound that felt like it could shatter glass. It was the sound of every nerve ending in his hand screaming in a chorus of liquid fire.
Jarren’s body arched back with such violent force that if I hadn’t been there to hold his shoulders, he would have thrown himself out of the chair. His eyes, which had been locked on mine, rolled back in his head, the pupils dilating in shock. His good hand crushed Cora’s with inhuman strength, the bones grinding together.
He thrashed. Even with the three of us holding him, he thrashed, a wild, convulsive bucking against the unrelenting torment. This wasn’t a conscious struggle; it was the primal, instinctual reaction of an animal caught in a trap, trying to rip its own limb off to escape the pain. His legs kicked out, sending the small supply table crashing to the floor.
“Hold him!” Cora grunted, his face a mask of strained empathy as he absorbed the crushing pressure on his hand.
Schneider, his own face pale and slick with sweat, held the gauze in place with grim determination. He had to. He had to keep it there. He had to cover every millimeter of the exposed tissue.
The initial shriek subsided, but it was replaced by something worse. A series of high-pitched, keening cries, the sounds of a man being pushed far beyond the limits of human endurance. His body went rigid, every muscle locked in a state of agonizing tension. He was fighting with every ounce of his will just to stay in the chair, to not collapse into a writhing heap on the floor.
And then, his mind broke.
The present became too much to bear, and he retreated, not into silence, but back in time, to the only other place he had known such focused, deliberate pain.
His eyes, which had been squeezed shut, flew open. But they weren’t seeing the trainer’s room. They were wide with a child’s terror, staring at a ghost only he could see.
“No!” he screamed, the word a desperate, childish plea. He started shaking his head frantically from side to side, his face streaked with tears and sweat. “I’ll get a hit! I promise! No more!”
His voice pitched higher, cracking with a terror that was decades old. He was no longer a 26-year-old All-Star. He was a small boy in a park, begging for the pain to stop.
“I be good!” he cried, the grammar of his childhood returning in his delirium. “Daddy!”
The word hung in the air, a devastating, heartbreaking confession. It struck the three of us like a physical blow. Cora flinched as if he’d been slapped, his eyes squeezing shut in shared agony. Casas let out a choked sound and turned his face away, unable to watch. I felt the sob catch in my own throat, a hot, painful lump.
We weren’t just holding a man anymore. We were holding a wounded child, trapped in a nightmare he couldn’t wake from.
Schneider, his jaw clenched so tight it looked like it might crack, finally lifted the gauze. The wound was a dark, angry brown, glistening with the antiseptic.
But the torment wasn’t over.
“I have to do the edges,” Schneider said, his voice a raw, strained whisper. “The skin around it. I have to make sure it’s sterile.”
He took a fresh piece of gauze, soaked it, and leaned in again, ready to restart the fire on a new front.
<Cora held Jarren in his arms>
<Jarren was to exhausted to fight. He was just enduing.>
<He make half-conscious murmurs, thinking he was being punished for every mistake in his life, every dropped fly ball, every strike out, and for not growing up, not big enough, not strong enough>
<His murmurs subdued into convulsions>
<add more details>
As Schneider leaned in with the fresh gauze, Jarren didn’t have the strength to fight anymore. The thrashing stopped. The screams died in his throat. All that was left was a deep, shuddering tremor that ran through his entire body, a constant, seismic hum of agony. He went limp in our arms, his body surrendering to a pain it could no longer resist.
Cora, seeing the fight go out of him, adjusted his grip. He pulled Jarren fully against him, cradling him, his arms a protective shield. Jarren’s head lolled onto Cora’s shoulder, his face slack, his eyes half-open and vacant. He was no longer in the room. He was lost in the delirium of pain, his mind a fever dream of past failures.
Schneider began to meticulously clean the edges of the wound, his touch as gentle as he could make it, but every dab of the antiseptic sent a fresh jolt through Jarren’s exhausted frame. He didn’t scream. He didn’t cry out. He just whimpered, a low, continuous sound of pure misery.
And then he began to talk.
His words were a slurred, half-conscious murmur, a confession whispered into the fabric of Cora’s shirt. It was a litany of every sin he had ever held against himself.
“S-sorry… dropped it…” he mumbled, his body twitching as if reliving a missed catch. “Shoulda had it… sorry…”
A moment of silence, then another tremor.
“Swung at a bad pitch… Knew it was bad… I’m sorry…”
His voice was a ghost, the words floating in the sterile air, each one a testament to a lifetime of self-flagellation. He was no longer just enduring the pain in his hand; he was reliving the pain of every mistake, every failure, every moment he hadn’t been perfect. The antiseptic wasn’t just cleaning a wound; it was searing away his soul.
“Not… not growing…” he whispered, the words so quiet they were almost lost. “Tried to… not big enough… not strong enough… sorry, Dad… sorry…”
That final, whispered apology was the most devastating blow of all. It was the voice of the five-year-old boy, convinced that his very existence was a disappointment.
Cora’s eyes were squeezed shut, tears tracking paths through the sweat on his own temples. He held Jarren tighter, as if he could physically absorb the pain, could shield the boy from the ghosts of his own past. Casas stood frozen, his hand still on Jarren’s leg, his face a portrait of helpless, heartbroken empathy. I kept my hand on Jarren’s back, the rhythmic circles the only thing I could offer, a silent, desperate prayer for the torment to end.
As Schneider administered the final, merciful wipe, Jarren’s murmurs faded. The words dissolved into a series of low, guttural moans. His body, having no language left to express the agony, began to speak in the only way it could. The tremors intensified, his limbs jerking in small, violent, uncontrollable convulsions. His teeth chattered. His body was trying to escape a pain that was everywhere, a pain that was not just in his hand, but in his heart, in his memory, in the very core of his being.
He was a man drowning, and all we could do was hold his head above the water and wait for the tide to recede.
<the ointment and bandage>
<More apologies, about the fly balls lost in light, about not rushing after the ball which caused an inside-the-park homerun, about caught stealing>
<half consciously looked at Craig, said about playing tomorrow, and some murmurs like “Go back to the park””Daddy’s waiting””Can’t fail”>
<add more details>
The moment Schneider set the antiseptic bottle down, a collective, unspoken sigh of relief filled the room. The worst was over. The fire had passed. All that remained was the smoldering wreckage.
Jarren’s convulsions slowly subsided, the violent tremors giving way to a deep, exhausted shuddering. He lay limp in Cora’s arms, a dead weight, his body completely spent. He was still murmuring, his mind still trapped in its fever dream of failure.
“Okay, JD,” Schneider said, his voice a gentle, weary whisper. “Last part. This part doesn’t hurt. This is the good stuff.”
He took a tube of silver sulfadiazine cream—a cooling, soothing balm for severe burns—and began to apply a thick, generous layer over the angry, brutalized wound. The cool ointment seemed to offer the first glimmer of relief Jarren had felt in an eternity. A long, low sigh escaped his lips, a sound of pure, unadulterated release.
But his mind was still in the park.
“The lights…” he mumbled, his voice slurred, his eyes still unfocused. “Couldn’t see it… lost it in the lights… sorry…” He was reliving a specific play, a specific error, a moment of failure seared into his memory. “My fault… shoulda had it…”
Schneider worked quickly, covering the entire wound with the thick, white cream. Then he placed a large, non-adherent pad over it.
“Inside-the-parker…” Jarren whispered, his head lolling to the side. “Didn’t… didn’t run hard enough… let the team down… sorry…”
Schneider began to wrap the hand, his movements practiced and gentle, starting at the wrist and working his way around the palm. Each layer of gauze was another layer of protection, another step away from the agony.
“Caught stealing…” he murmured, his voice barely audible. “Shouldn’t have gone… cost us the game… my fault…”
The litany of his failures was a heartbreaking soundtrack to his own treatment. He was a man who kept a perfect, running ledger of every mistake he had ever made.
When the hand was fully wrapped, a thick, white cocoon of gauze, Schneider taped it securely. The procedure was finally, truly, over.
Cora gently eased Jarren back into a sitting position, though he kept a steadying arm around his shoulders. Jarren’s head slumped forward, his chin resting on his chest. He was conscious, but only just.
After a long moment of silence, he slowly, sluggishly, lifted his head. His eyes, glassy and unfocused, drifted around the room. They landed on me. It took a second for his exhausted mind to register who I was.
“Craig…” he slurred, his voice thick.
“I’m right here, Jarren,” I said softly, my voice full of a gentleness I didn’t know I possessed.
He tried to push himself up in the chair, a flicker of his ingrained programming returning. “Gotta… gotta play tomorrow…” he mumbled. “Get back… get back to the park…”
His eyes lost focus again, staring at a ghost behind me.
“Daddy’s waiting…” he whispered, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek. “Can’t fail…”
And with that, his body finally gave up. His eyes rolled back, and he slumped forward, his consciousness surrendering completely, passing out into the waiting, protective embrace of his manager.
<imagine the reaction of Triston, Cora, Craig the the trainer>
<After a long while, Jarren stirred in Cora's arms and woke up>
<add more details>
<stop the scene when Jarren woke up>
The moment Jarren’s consciousness fled, the last of his strength giving out, the room was plunged into a profound, heavy silence. The only sound was the soft, exhausted breathing of the four men left awake.
Cora adjusted his grip, cradling Jarren’s unconscious form against his chest, his expression a complex storm of emotions: fierce protectiveness, profound sadness, and a deep, simmering anger at the forces that had brought them to this point. He looked down at the man in his arms, not as a player, but as a son, his jaw tight with a love that was painful to witness.
Triston Casas, who had been a silent, stoic pillar, finally let his own composure crack. He took a step back, his big frame seeming to shrink. He ran a hand over his face, his eyes wide with a mixture of horror and awe. “I’ve… I’ve never seen anything like that,” he whispered to no one in particular, his voice hoarse. He looked at the pristine white bandage on Jarren’s hand, then back at his slack face. “The things he was saying… my God.” He shook his head and walked over to the far wall, leaning against it heavily, as if he needed its support to stay upright. He was a young man who had just been given a terrifying glimpse into the true cost of playing this game at the highest level.
Schneider, the professional, was already cleaning up the last of the supplies, his movements slow, weary. He worked with his back to us, but I could see the tension in his shoulders. He had inflicted necessary, therapeutic pain, but he was a healer by nature. The sounds of Jarren’s screams, the litany of his self-hatred, would stay with him for a long time. He had done his job perfectly, but there was no victory in it.
And me… I just stood there, my hand still resting on the empty chair back. I felt hollowed out, scoured clean by the raw, unfiltered humanity I had just witnessed. Every theory I had, every strategy I had formulated, felt like a child’s drawing in the face of that reality. I had thought I understood his pain from the woman’s story. I had understood nothing. To hear it described is one thing. To witness it, to feel the tremors of it through your own hand, to hear the ghosts of his past spill from his lips… it changes you.
I looked at the three men in the room with me. The manager turned father. The teammate turned brother. The healer turned reluctant torturer. We were a broken, makeshift family, bound together by this shared, terrible secret.
We stayed like that for what felt like an eternity, a silent vigil in the fluorescent glare of the trainer’s room. The distant, muffled roar of the crowd from the world outside was a mockery, a sound from a frivolous universe that had no knowledge of the real war that had just been fought in this small, sterile space.
After a long while, there was a stir.
Jarren’s head moved against Cora’s shoulder. A low groan escaped his lips. His eyelids fluttered, then opened. They were no longer glassy and unfocused. They were clear, though clouded with a deep, bone-weary exhaustion and a dawning, horrified awareness.
He slowly, painfully, pushed himself upright, away from the comfort of Cora’s embrace. He looked down at his hand, now a thick, white, alien thing. He looked at the overturned table, at the tear tracks on Casas’s face, at the profound sadness in my own eyes.
He was back. And he was beginning to remember.
<Jarren felt ashamed of his own breakdown>
<He tried to redeem in the only way he knew: insist on playing tomorrow>
<They assured him he’s not weak, he was tough beyond description>
<Craig made the decision for him: IL>
<add more details>
<keep the scene here. More on Cora and Jarren’s reactions>
Jarren’s eyes darted around the room, taking in the silent, exhausted faces, the overturned table, the palpable weight of the emotional wreckage. A deep, dark flush of shame crept up his neck, coloring his pale face. He pulled away from Cora completely, trying to sit up straight in the chair, to reclaim some semblance of control, of dignity.
He wouldn’t look at any of us. He stared at his own knees, his shoulders hunched, trying to make himself smaller.
“I…” he started, his voice a raw, hoarse croak. He cleared his throat, the sound painful. “I’m sorry.”
“Don’t you dare,” Cora said, his voice a low, fierce growl that was full of love, not anger. “Do not apologize. Not for that. Do you hear me?”
Jarren flinched at the intensity but didn’t look up. The shame was a physical weight, pressing him down. He had broken down. He had cried. He had screamed. In his mind, he had failed the ultimate test. And now, his programming kicked in, the deeply ingrained instinct to fix it, to redeem himself the only way he knew how.
“I’m good,” he said, the words a transparent lie. He tried to push himself to his feet, a wobbly, uncoordinated movement. “I’ll be ready for tomorrow. I can play. I can DH. Just… just tape a bat to my hand. I can do it.”
Casas let out a short, sharp, incredulous laugh that held no humor. “Dude, no. Just… no.”
“Jarren, stop,” I said, my voice firm but gentle. I stepped forward, putting a hand on his shoulder to stop his attempt to stand. “Listen to me. What you just did in this room… that wasn’t weakness. That was the toughest damn thing I have ever seen in my life.”
He finally looked up at me, his eyes full of confusion and disbelief.
“Weakness is hiding,” I continued, my voice unwavering. “Weakness is letting this stuff fester until it breaks you for good. What you just did was feel. You let it out. You let us in. That takes a kind of courage that has nothing to do with playing through pain.”
“He’s right, mijo,” Cora said, his voice softening. “I have never been prouder of you than I am right now. Not after any home run. Not after any great catch. Right now.”
Jarren stared at us, his mind struggling to process a reality that was so completely at odds with his entire life’s experience. We weren’t disgusted. We weren’t disappointed. We were proud. It didn’t make sense. The shame was still there, a toxic whisper in his ear. He shook his head, falling back on the only truth he knew.
“I have to play,” he insisted, his voice pleading. “I have to get back out there. I have to… I have to fix it.”
I looked at Cora, a silent communication passing between us. The decision was made. It was time to take the burden of choice away from him completely.
I knelt down in front of him again, forcing him to meet my gaze.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice calm, steady, and absolute. “You’re not playing tomorrow. You’re not playing the day after that. I’m putting you on the 10-day Injured List, effective immediately. It’s already been filed with the league office. It’s done.”
His face crumpled. It wasn’t anger this time. It was a look of utter devastation. In his mind, I had just officially branded him a failure.
“No, Craig, please…”
“This is not a punishment,” I said, cutting him off firmly. “This is a protection. It is my job to protect you, especially when you can’t protect yourself. Your only job for the next ten days is to do nothing but heal. You will not swing a bat. You will not throw a ball. You will focus on your body and your mind. You will let this team carry the weight for a while. That is not a request. It is my final decision as the General Manager of this baseball club.”
I held his gaze, my own unwavering. I was the authority figure. I was the one making the decision. But I hoped, prayed, that the context we had built—the support, the empathy, the shared trauma in this room—would make this feel different. Not like a punishment from his father, but like a lifeline from his family.
He stared at me, the fight finally draining out of him, replaced by a profound, weary resignation. He had no more arguments to make. He had no more strength to fight. The decision was out of his hands.
He slumped back in the chair, a single tear rolling down his cheek, and gave a small, almost imperceptible nod.
<Cora held Jarren and rocked him like his own son>
<For the first time in his life, Jarren admitted his pains and accepted comfort>
<He sobbed into Cora’s chest, like a child finally home after being long lost>
<add more details>
The single, defeated nod was a white flag. It was the surrender of a lifetime of fighting, a quiet admission that he could not carry this burden alone anymore.
The moment he conceded, Cora moved. He didn’t hesitate. He closed the small distance between them and wrapped his arms around Jarren again, pulling him forward until Jarren’s head was resting on his shoulder. This time, it wasn’t to restrain him or to brace him for pain. It was an embrace of pure, unconditional acceptance.
“It’s okay, mijo,” Cora whispered, his voice thick with emotion. “It’s okay. We got you. We got you.”
And with those words, with the finality of my decision, with the safety of his manager’s arms, the last of Jarren’s defenses crumbled into dust.
He didn’t just cry. He wept.
It was a sound that hollowed out the soul. It was the sound of twenty years of repressed pain, of every silent tear he had swallowed, of every scream he had choked back in that park, of the crushing weight of a love he thought he had to earn. It all came pouring out in a flood of raw, ragged, heartbroken sobs that shook his entire frame.
He clung to Cora, his hands gripping the back of his manager’s jersey, not with the strength of an athlete, but with the desperate, clinging grip of a lost child who has finally, finally been found. He wasn’t a player. He wasn’t an All-Star. He was just a boy who had been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders, and for the first time in his life, someone was letting him set it down.
Cora held him, rocking him gently, his own eyes squeezed shut. He murmured to him in Spanish, a soft, rhythmic litany of comfort. “Está bien, mi campeón… Ya pasó… Estamos aquí…” It’s okay, my champion… It’s over now… We are here…
Casas, his own face a mess of tears, quietly walked over and placed a hand on Jarren’s shaking back, a silent, steadying presence. Schneider, his job done, began to quietly pack up his remaining supplies, giving them their space, his own expression one of profound, weary respect.
I stood back, a silent guardian, witnessing the most important moment of our season. It wasn’t a walk-off home run or a pennant-clinching victory. It was this. It was the moment a man who had been taught that pain was a currency finally learned that comfort was not something to be earned, but something to be given. It was the moment he finally accepted it.
He sobbed until he had nothing left, until the storm passed, leaving behind only the deep, shuddering breaths of exhaustion and release. He didn’t pull away. He just rested there, in the safety of his manager’s arms, like a child who had wandered for years in a dark wood and had finally, against all hope, found his way home.
<Jarren gathered enough strength to stand up>
<He was reluctant to go back to clubhouse. He thought teammates would see him as weak>
<But there was only care and support in the clubhouse>
<add more details>
After what felt like a lifetime, the shuddering sobs subsided into a deep, exhausted calm. Jarren stirred, his breathing evening out. He slowly, wearily, pushed himself back, disengaging from Cora’s embrace. He sat up in the chair, his movements heavy, his body drained.
He didn’t look at any of us. He stared down at his bandaged hand, then at the floor, his face still blotchy and tear-streaked. The shame, which had been washed away by the flood of emotion, began to creep back in, a slow, cold tide.
“I need… I need a minute,” he mumbled, his voice a raw, scraped whisper.
“Take all the time you need,” I said softly.
He used his good hand to push himself up from the chair. He was unsteady on his feet, his body still trembling with the aftershocks of the ordeal. Casas instinctively reached out to steady him, but Jarren waved him off with a small, weak gesture. He needed to do this himself. He walked over to the far wall, the same one Casas had leaned against, and placed his forehead against the cool, painted cinder blocks, his back to us. He just stood there, breathing. Trying to piece himself back together.
We gave him the silence he needed. After a few minutes, he took a deep, shaky breath and turned around. He still wouldn’t meet our eyes, but his posture was a little straighter.
“Okay,” he said, his voice still rough. “I’m… okay. I should… I should go back to the clubhouse.”
The words were laced with a deep, profound dread. The trainer’s room had become a sanctuary of shared trauma. The clubhouse was the outside world. It was where the other players were. The players who hadn’t seen what happened. The players who would only see his red-rimmed eyes and his bandaged hand.
“They’re gonna… they’re gonna see,” he whispered, his gaze still fixed on the floor. “They’ll think I’m… weak.”
“No, they won’t,” Casas said immediately, his voice firm. “They’re gonna see you’re hurt. That’s it. We got your back, man. All of us.”
“He’s right,” Cora said, his voice gentle but absolute. “But you don’t have to face them alone.”
Cora stood up and walked to the door. He opened it and poked his head out. I could hear the low murmur of the clubhouse beyond. He said something I couldn’t hear, then stepped back inside, leaving the door ajar.
A moment later, Rafael Devers appeared in the doorway. He took in the scene—Jarren by the wall, me, Cora, Casas, the overturned table—and his face, which had been full of concern, softened with a deep, immediate understanding. He didn’t ask what happened. He didn’t need to.
He walked straight to Jarren.
“Hey,” Raffy said softly. He put a hand on Jarren’s shoulder. “I heard you had a little run-in with the warning track.”
Jarren finally looked up, meeting his teammate’s eyes, his own full of shame and apprehension.
Devers just smiled, a kind, gentle smile. “Don’t worry about the game. We got it. You just worry about you. We need you healthy.” He squeezed Jarren’s shoulder. “Come on. Let’s go get you some food. You look like hell.”
It was the perfect thing to say. It was normal. It was brotherly. It acknowledged the injury without acknowledging the breakdown. It offered support without offering pity.
Jarren hesitated for a moment, then gave a small, grateful nod.
With Devers on one side and Casas on the other, they walked him out of the trainer’s room. It wasn’t a procession of the weak. It was an honor guard.
I followed a few steps behind with Cora. As we stepped into the clubhouse, I saw that the usual post-game atmosphere of scattered conversations and loud music was gone. The room was quiet. Players were sitting at their lockers, talking in low tones. Every eye turned to Jarren as he entered.
There were no jeers. No jokes. No questions.
There was only a quiet, profound, and universal respect.
Nick Pivetta walked over and patted Jarren’s good shoulder. “Tough break, man. Heal up.”
Trevor Story gave him a nod from across the room. “We got you, JD.”
One by one, players offered small gestures of support. A fist bump to his good arm. A quiet word. A nod of solidarity. They had seen him pulled from the game. They saw the bandage. They saw his face. And they understood. They closed ranks.
He wasn’t an outcast. He wasn’t seen as weak. He was one of them. He was their brother, and he was hurt. And in the quiet, understated, fiercely loyal world of a baseball clubhouse, that was the only thing that mattered.

Analyzing the Core Event
I'm currently breaking down the initial prompt to understand its key elements. I've identified that the scene hinges on Jarren's overnight stay at the ballpark's medical facility, possibly due to medical concerns. I'm focusing on "observation for infection" as a potential reason. Further exploration of this will flesh out the story details.
Refining the Setting
I'm now focusing on setting the scene. The post-game atmosphere is key – the transition from the bustling clubhouse to a quieter medical facility. I'm imagining the team doctor's role in the decision-making process, ensuring a realistic and medically sound scenario. Jarren's exhaustion will define his reaction, showcasing his vulnerability.
Defining the Vigil's Significance
I'm now delving into the emotional core of the scene. The "worktable" setup is key, it shows a subtle demonstration of support by Breslow and Cora. Their silent presence speaks volumes, contrasting with Jarren's vulnerable state. I'm focusing on the male characters' ways of expressing concern without explicit words, highlighting the new team culture. I will visualize the scene's emotional weight, emphasizing the contrast between the sterile room and the personal connection.
Reflecting on Comfort
I'm now delving into the ways Breslow and Cora can provide comfort. I've considered that the men might not be comfortable with obvious emotional displays, yet they feel compelled to show their care. Therefore, the setup allows for a constant, silent presence, a gesture more personal than a verbal reassurance. I'm visualizing the subtle actions of Breslow and Cora. Their actions will subtly communicate their support, emphasizing their bond and team dynamics.
Exploring Comforting Actions
My current focus is on the comfort the team provides. I'm visualizing the subtle actions of Breslow and Cora. Their silent presence and work at the table offer a steady reassurance, a non-verbal expression of care that feels more authentic than explicit reassurances. I'm exploring their individual reactions to Jarren's restlessness, ensuring each character's response aligns with their established roles and personalities within this new team culture. I will visualize the stark contrast between the sterile medical room and the personal connections unfolding within it.
Defining the Comfort
I'm now focusing on the comfort element of the scene. Jarren's exhaustion suggests vulnerability, which is crucial for highlighting Breslow and Cora's subtle care. I will visualize the comfort, not as grand gestures, but through their steady presence and quiet work. This showcases the depth of concern within the new team dynamics.
The clubhouse slowly emptied, the sounds of showers, closing lockers, and quiet goodbyes fading into a low hum. The game was over, a lopsided win that felt like a footnote to a much larger, more significant event.
The team doctor, after a brief consultation with Schneider, made the official call. “He’s not going home tonight,” he said to me and Cora, his voice firm. “With an abrasion that severe, the infection risk in the first 24 hours is significant. I want him on a precautionary IV drip, and we’ll monitor for any sign of fever. Besides,” he added, his gaze softening as he looked toward the quiet corner where Jarren was sitting, “he lives alone. I don’t want him to be alone tonight.”
There was no argument. It was the right call, both medically and humanly.
We set him up in the small, private medical observation room off the main training area. It was a simple space, with a hospital-style bed, a heart monitor, and an IV stand. It was sterile and impersonal, but it was safe.
Jarren, too exhausted to protest, allowed himself to be led to the bed. He was a ghost, his movements slow, his eyes hollowed out with a weariness that went far beyond physical. He lay down, his bandaged hand resting carefully on a pillow, and within minutes, he was asleep, his body finally succumbing to the profound exhaustion.
The room was quiet, save for the soft, rhythmic beep of the monitor and the gentle hiss of the IV drip. Cora and I stood there for a long moment, two men watching over a sleeping son.
“I’m not going anywhere,” Cora said, his voice a low rumble. It wasn’t a question or a declaration. It was a statement of fact.
“Neither am I,” I replied.
I went out into the now-empty clubhouse and found a rolling equipment table. Cora grabbed two chairs. We wheeled them into the small room, setting up a makeshift workstation next to Jarren’s bed. We opened our laptops, the soft glow of the screens pushing back against the dim light of the room. The work of a manager and a GM never truly stops. There were reports to file, travel itineraries to approve, scouting videos to watch.
But we weren’t really working.
We were standing vigil.
The hours crawled by. The sounds of the ballpark died completely, leaving only the low hum of the building’s life support. We typed in silence, the quiet clicking of our keyboards a strange counterpoint to the steady beep of the heart monitor.
Around 2 a.m., Jarren stirred. A low whimper escaped his lips. His bandaged hand twitched on the pillow. He was dreaming. Reliving it.
Cora was out of his chair in an instant. He moved to the bedside and placed a hand gently on Jarren’s forehead. “Shhh, mijo,” he whispered, his voice a soft, comforting anchor. “Estoy aquí. It’s over.” He smoothed Jarren’s hair back, his touch infinitely paternal. Jarren’s breathing hitched, then settled. The nightmare receded. Cora stood there for a long minute, just watching, before returning to his chair.
An hour later, it happened again. This time, it was words. Mumbled, broken phrases from the past.
“Sorry… be better… not strong enough…”
I was the one who stood up this time. I walked to the bed and looked down at him. His face was tense, his brow furrowed in his sleep. He was fighting battles even in his dreams.
I didn’t touch him. I just spoke, my voice low and firm, a statement of undeniable fact. “You are safe, Jarren,” I said. “It’s over. You are strong enough.”
He seemed to quiet at the sound of my voice, the tension in his face easing slightly. The ghosts, for a moment, were held at bay.
We fell into a rhythm. One of us would work while the other watched. We were a silent, two-man guard, ensuring that if he woke, if he cried out, he would not find himself alone in the dark. This was the new culture in its purest, most practical form. It wasn’t a memo or a meeting. It was two laptops and two chairs in a quiet room in the middle of the night. It was a shared responsibility, a silent promise that the man was more important than the game.
As the first hints of dawn began to soften the Boston sky, I looked over at Cora. His head was bowed, his eyes closed, his laptop forgotten. He was asleep in his chair, a weary soldier at his post. I looked at Jarren, sleeping peacefully now, the steady beep of the monitor a comforting rhythm.
I turned back to my screen, the words blurring in front of my tired eyes. I wasn’t managing assets or analyzing data anymore. I was watching over a life.
This was the job now. And it was the most important work I would ever do.

<the fever came in the morning. Coaches and teammates took turns to look after Jarren when Craig and Cora got some rest><add more details>
The first sign was subtle. Around 6 a.m., as the city began to stir, the steady, rhythmic beep of the heart monitor quickened slightly. I looked up from my laptop, my tired eyes instantly alert. Jarren was still asleep, but a faint flush was creeping up his neck, and his breathing was shallower than before.
I walked over and gently placed the back of my hand on his forehead. It was warm. Too warm.
“Alex,” I said softly. Cora’s head snapped up, his eyes immediately sharp. “He’s got a fever.”
The next hour was a blur of quiet, efficient action. Schneider and the team doctor were summoned. They confirmed a low-grade fever, a sign that his body was fighting, but also a warning that the infection risk was now a reality. They adjusted his IV, adding a broad-spectrum antibiotic to the mix.
Jarren woke during the process, his eyes hazy with fever and confusion. He was weak, his earlier exhaustion now compounded by the brewing sickness. He didn’t protest. He just endured, his gaze drifting between me and Cora, a silent, trusting reliance in his eyes that was a world away from the terrified defiance of the night before.
By 8 a.m., the ballpark was coming to life. Players began to trickle in for their morning workouts. The news spread quickly, not through official channels, but through the quiet, efficient grapevine of a concerned clubhouse.
The vigil changed hands.
The first to arrive was Devers. He walked into the small room, his usual boisterous energy replaced by a quiet, serious concern. He looked at me and Cora, at our rumpled clothes and tired eyes.
“Go,” Raffy said, his voice a low command. “Get some sleep. Get some coffee. We’ll take first watch.”
He pulled up a chair. A few minutes later, Triston Casas joined him, a container of coffee in one hand and a breakfast sandwich in the other, which he placed on the table next to Cora’s laptop. They didn’t need to be asked. They just showed up.
I hesitated, reluctant to leave my post.
“Craig,” Cora said, his voice rough with exhaustion. “They’re right. We’re no good to him like this. Let the team do its job.”
We retreated to my office. Kevin had brought in a change of clothes for both of us. As I showered and changed in my private bathroom, I felt the immense weight of the night begin to settle. But it was a shared weight now.
When I returned to the medical room an hour later, the scene had shifted. Devers and Casas were gone. In their place sat Nick Pivetta and Alex Bregman. Pivetta was reading a book, a silent, steady presence. Bregman was on his phone, but his attention wasn’t on the screen; it was on the man in the bed. They were the veterans, the leaders, projecting an aura of calm, professional control.
And so it went, all day. The team, unprompted and unmanaged, created its own rotation.
The rookies—Rafaela, Mayer, Anthony—came in a group, their youthful energy hushed with a solemn respect. They stood awkwardly by the door for a few minutes, just wanting to show their support, before one of the coaches shooed them out to get their work in.
The bullpen guys, used to waiting, took a long shift in the afternoon. Kenley Jansen, Chris Martin—they sat in comfortable silence, the quiet camaraderie of the bullpen transported to a sick room.
Even the coaching staff took turns. The hitting coach, the third base coach—they would pop in, check on him, share a quiet word with whoever was on duty, and leave. It was a silent, seamless expression of the organization’s new soul.
Jarren drifted in and out of a feverish sleep. Sometimes he’d wake, confused, and the teammate on duty would offer him a sip of water, or just a reassuring word. “We’re here, JD. Just rest.”
They weren’t just watching over a player. They were guarding one of their own. They were repaying the loyalty of the man who, in his own timeline, had become their mentor. They were proving, in the most tangible way possible, that he was not a burden. He was their brother.
Late in the afternoon, I stood in the doorway, watching as Trevor Story sat by the bed, quietly telling a sleeping Jarren about his own kids. I looked at the informal rotation schedule that someone had taped to the door. Every player had a slot.
I thought of the woman’s words, of the lonely robot protecting a galaxy. She had been wrong. The burden wasn’t mine to carry alone. It was ours. And in that quiet, shared responsibility, I saw the foundation of a true championship team being forged, not in the fire of competition, but in the quiet crucible of compassion.
<The fever threatened to get out of control the next day.><Doctor decided to change the bandage, search for more debris, and put stronger antiseptic on the wound><They tried to do so without sedative, given it may be dangerous for Jarren>
<add more details>
<Stop the scene when the doctors and nurses entered, before they touched Jarren>
The second day was worse.
The quiet hope of the first night curdled into a tense, gnawing anxiety. The fever, which had been low-grade, began to climb steadily throughout the morning. By noon, it was a real concern. The antibiotics weren’t winning the fight. The infection was pushing back, hard.
Jarren was miserable. He was caught in a miserable limbo between a feverish, restless sleep and a weak, pained consciousness. He was shivering despite the sweat that beaded on his pale skin. The team’s vigil continued, a rotating guard of familiar faces, but their quiet support was now tinged with a palpable worry.
Around 3 p.m., the team doctor, a man named Dr. Evans with a calm demeanor that was beginning to fray at the edges, made the call. He found me and Cora in the now-empty clubhouse, where we were trying to force down some food.
“It’s not responding,” Evans said, his voice grim. “The fever is climbing, and his white blood cell count is elevated. The infection is localized in the hand, but it’s aggressive. I have to go back in.”
I felt a cold knot form in my stomach. “Go back in?”
“I have to unwrap it,” he explained, his eyes full of a weary apology. “I need to search for any microscopic debris we might have missed, something for the bacteria to cling to. And I need to hit it with a stronger, more caustic antiseptic. Betadine this time. It’s going to be… significantly more painful than the iodine.”
The memory of Jarren’s screams, of his delirious, childish pleas, echoed in the room. The thought of putting him through that again was unbearable.
“Sedate him,” Cora said immediately, his voice a low, hard command. “Knock him out. He can’t go through that again.”
Dr. Evans shook his head slowly. “I can’t, Alex. Not safely. With the fever, the dehydration, the stress his body is under… general anesthesia is too risky. Even a heavy sedative could compromise his breathing. We have to do this with him awake. I’m sorry.”
The words hung in the air, a death sentence. We had to walk him back into hell, and this time, the flames would be hotter.
“Get everyone out,” I said, my voice hollow. “Clear the clubhouse. No one should see this. Just the essential staff.”
We walked back to the medical room. The atmosphere had transformed from a quiet sickroom into a pre-operative theater. A nurse was there, setting up a new, more formidable tray of instruments. The smell of antiseptic was sharp, biting.
Jarren was awake, barely. He looked at us as we entered, his eyes hazy with fever but sharp with a dawning, animal fear. He knew. He could feel the shift in the room. He saw the new tray, the determined look on the doctor’s face.
“No,” he whispered, his voice a dry, cracked rasp. He started to try and push himself up, a pathetic, weak attempt to flee. “No, please… no more…”
Dr. Evans stepped forward, his voice gentle but firm. “Jarren, listen to me. There’s an infection. It’s getting worse. If we don’t stop it right now, it could get into your bloodstream. That’s a whole different world of trouble. We have to do this. It’s the only way.”
The doctor and the nurse moved to the side of the bed. They were calm, professional, their faces set with a grim resolve. They were ready to begin. The nightmare was about to start all over again.
<The fever threatened to get out of control the next day. Jarren was unconscious almost all the time><Doctor decided to change the bandage, search for more debris, and put stronger antiseptic on the wound><They tried to do so without sedative, given it may be dangerous for Jarren> <add more details> <Stop the scene when the doctors and nurses entered, before they touched Jarren>
The second day was a descent. The low-grade fever of the morning had stubbornly, malevolently, climbed throughout the night. By dawn of day three, it was raging. The number on the digital thermometer was a stark, terrifying red flag. Jarren was no longer just sleeping; he was almost entirely unconscious, lost in a feverish fog, his body burning from within.
The quiet concern of the previous day had evaporated, replaced by a tense, palpable fear that hung heavy in the air. The steady, rhythmic beep of the heart monitor was faster now, a frantic, urgent tempo.
The team doctor, his face grim and etched with worry, stood at the foot of the bed, conferring in low, urgent tones with a new face—an infectious disease specialist he had called in from Mass General.
“The antibiotics aren’t holding it,” the specialist said, his voice sharp and clinical. “The fever is climbing, and his white blood cell count is through the roof. The infection is localized in the hand, but if we don’t get it under control, we’re looking at sepsis. We have to assume there’s still foreign matter in that wound, something the initial debridement missed.”
He turned to me and Cora, who were standing by the door, running on fumes and black coffee. “We have to go back in. We need to unwrap it, re-debride it, and hit it with a stronger, more aggressive antiseptic. Betadine this time. We need to be certain it’s sterile.”
A cold dread, colder than anything I had felt during the initial procedure, washed over me. I looked at Jarren’s still form, at the flush on his cheeks, at the way his chest rose and fell with shallow, rapid breaths. He was already so weak, so depleted.
“Sedate him,” Cora said immediately, his voice a raw plea. “You can’t… you can’t put him through that again. Not like this.”
The specialist shook his head, his expression regretful but firm. “I can’t, Alex. Not with a fever this high and his system under this much stress. The risks of respiratory depression are too significant. We have to do this with local anesthetics only. It’s the safer medical choice.”
The safer medical choice. The words were a cruel joke. We were being asked to stand by and watch a man, already unconscious and fighting for his health, be subjected to a level of agony that had broken him when he was strong.
The decision was made. The room transformed from a quiet sick bay into a pre-op theater. A team of nurses from the hospital arrived, their movements crisp and efficient. They brought in a larger crash cart, sterile drapes, and a tray of instruments that made the first set look like toys. The air crackled with a new, terrifying urgency.
They gently roused Jarren, trying to bring him to a state of semi-consciousness. His eyes fluttered open, but they were glassy, unfocused, lost in the fever. He mumbled something incoherent.
“Jarren,” the doctor said, his voice loud and clear, trying to cut through the fog. “We need to work on your hand again. We’re going to numb it, but it’s going to be uncomfortable. We need you to try and stay as still as you can.”
There was no sign of recognition, no flicker of understanding. He was a passenger in his own body, a prisoner of the fever.
The nurses and doctors began to move around him, their blue scrubs a stark contrast to the white sheets. They positioned his arm. They prepped the local anesthetics. They laid out the sterile drapes, isolating the bandaged hand.
Cora, Casas, and I instinctively moved to our stations, forming the same human shield we had two days prior. But this time felt different. It was colder. More clinical. More desperate. We weren’t just protecting a man from his own fear. We were about to hold down a sick, unconscious man while he was subjected to a procedure that his body would register as pure, unadulterated torture.
The specialist, gloved and masked, picked up the bandage scissors. He positioned the blunt tip under the edge of the thick gauze cocoon.
The room held its breath. The first cut was about to be made.

<Doctors were expecting a weak patient, not a trapped animal with the strength of world class athletic>
<Their first attempt only served to wake up the wild animal>
<Jarren’s eyes opened, but they were wild, with no consciousness. He was fighting the demons.>
<Jarren fought them off, they backed up into a circle>
<add more details>
<stop the scene here. Before the second attempt was made.>
The specialist made the first careful snip into the thick layers of gauze.
The reaction was instantaneous and terrifyingly violent.
It was as if the cold steel of the scissors had sent a jolt of pure adrenaline straight into Jarren’s heart. His body, which had been limp and unresponsive, exploded with a strength that defied his feverish state. It was not the coordinated strength of an athlete, but the raw, primal power of a cornered animal fighting for its life.
He let out a guttural roar, a sound of pure, instinctual rage, and ripped his arm away from the doctors. His eyes flew open, but there was no one home. They were wide, wild, and completely disconnected from the room, seeing horrors only he could see. He wasn’t fighting the doctors; he was fighting the demons the fever had unleashed.
He thrashed, kicking out with his powerful legs, sending the instrument tray flying across the room with a deafening crash of metal on linoleum. The nurses scrambled back, their professional calm shattered by the sudden, unexpected violence. The specialist, who had been leaning over the bed, was thrown backward, stumbling to regain his footing.
“Hold him!” the doctor yelled, a command born of shock and urgency.
Cora and Casas, who had been at his side, lunged forward, trying to control his flailing limbs. But they were caught off guard, unprepared for this level of explosive, unconscious power. Jarren threw Casas’s considerable weight off him as if he were a child. He shoved Cora back, his movements frantic and uncoordinated.
I moved in, trying to grab his shoulders, but it was like trying to wrestle with a lightning strike. He was all instinct, all power, fueled by a feverish delirium that gave him no sense of pain or limitation. He scrambled off the bed, his hospital gown tearing at the shoulder, the IV line ripping from his arm, leaving a smear of blood.
He got to his feet, unsteady but upright, in the center of the small room. He was panting, his chest heaving, his wild eyes darting around at the circle of blue scrubs and familiar faces. He didn’t see us. He saw threats. He saw ghosts. He saw his father in the park. He saw the fan in Cleveland. He saw every demon he had ever faced, all of them converging on him in this small, sterile room.
He backed away, stumbling against the far wall, his bandaged hand held up not in a defensive posture, but as if it were a foreign object, the source of all this torment. He crouched slightly, a wild animal ready to spring, a low growl rumbling in his chest.
The room was a frozen tableau of shock and fear. The medical team, trained for calm procedures, was backed up against the door, their faces pale. Cora, Casas, and I formed a loose, hesitant semi-circle around him, our hands outstretched, our voices low and useless.
“Jarren… mijo… it’s us…” Cora pleaded, his voice trembling slightly.
But Jarren didn’t hear him. He was gone. The fever had burned away the man, and all that was left was the raw, terrified, fighting spirit of a boy who had learned that the only way to survive pain was to meet it with overwhelming, desperate force.
We had lost him. And we had no idea how to get him back.
<the first doctor who was brave enough stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. It almost gave the doctor a haricut.>
<Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning>
<It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done>
<add more details>
<stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
The standoff held for a long, tense moment, the only sounds in the room Jarren’s ragged, guttural breathing and the frantic, high-pitched beeping of the heart monitor he was no longer attached to. He was a caged tiger, his wild eyes promising violence to anyone who dared approach.
The infectious disease specialist, his professional duty overriding his fear, decided to test the perimeter. He took a slow, deliberate step forward, his hands held up in a placating gesture. “Jarren,” he said, his voice as calm as he could make it. “Son, we are trying to help you. You have to let us…”
He never finished the sentence.
With a speed that was utterly shocking, a speed that defied his feverish state, Jarren’s good hand shot out. He snatched a heavy glass water pitcher from the bedside table—a table he wasn’t even looking at—and hurled it. It wasn’t a throw; it was a missile. The glass blurred through the air, aimed not at the doctor’s body, but at his head.
The specialist yelped and threw himself backward, the pitcher whistling past his ear with an inch to spare. It shattered against the wall behind him, a deafening explosion of glass and water that sprayed across the room. Shards rained down on the linoleum floor.
The act of violence seemed to drain some of Jarren’s frantic energy, but it solidified his territorial claim. He let out a low, warning roar, a sound from deep in his chest, and sank lower into his crouch. He was guarding the invisible line he had drawn on the floor.
The message was brutally, unequivocally clear: Cross this line, and I will hurt you.
The medical team was in full retreat now, huddled near the doorway, their faces a mixture of shock and genuine fear. The head nurse was on her phone, her voice a hushed, urgent whisper. “Security to the training room. And get me an anesthesiologist. Now.”
The doctor who had nearly been hit was pale, his hand trembling as he touched his own hair where the pitcher had passed. He looked at me, his eyes wide. “We can’t do this,” he said, his voice shaky. “We can’t treat him like this. It’s not safe for him or for us. We have to sedate him. It’s the only way.”
I knew he was right. The risks of sedation, which had seemed so significant before, were now dwarfed by the immediate, violent reality of the situation. We were no longer choosing between a safe procedure and a risky one. We were choosing between a risky procedure and no procedure at all. And no procedure meant the infection would win.
“Do it,” I said, my voice a grim command. “Get what you need.”
But that presented a new, impossible problem. To sedate him, they had to get close to him. They had to get a needle into a vein. They had to cross the line.
Every time a nurse or doctor even shifted their weight, preparing to make an attempt, Jarren would let out another low, menacing growl. His eyes would lock onto them, a predator tracking its prey. He was coiled, ready to spring, ready to throw whatever else he could get his hands on.
We were at an impasse. A terrifying, dangerous stalemate. The man we needed to save was now the feral, formidable guardian at the gate of his own recovery, and he was refusing to let anyone pass.

<Cora realized it was the white uniform and scent of antiseptic on the medical staff that scared Jarren. He saw the helplessness beneath the rage>
<Cora stepped up with open hands, showing he had nothing to hurt Jarren>
<Jarren seemed to recognize Cora>
<Cora talked Jarren into going back to the bed, holding him like his own son>
<Craig and Casas held Jarren>
<the medical staff tried to do this without sedative>
<add more details>
<stop the scene before their second attempt>
The stalemate stretched, thick and suffocating. The air was a tense mixture of fear, antiseptic, and the low, menacing growl rumbling in Jarren’s chest. He was a cornered animal, and the blue and white scrubs of the medical staff were the color of the trap.
Then, I saw the realization dawn on Alex Cora’s face. He wasn’t looking at Jarren’s aggression. He was looking past it, through it, at the source. He saw the wild, terrified eyes, and he understood. It wasn’t us he was fighting. It was the procedure. It was the pain. It was the color of the uniforms that had held him down while he was burned alive.
Cora turned to the medical team. “Everybody out,” he said, his voice a low, absolute command.
The specialist started to protest. “Alex, we need to…”
“OUT,” Cora repeated, his voice like iron. “Now. Go wait in the hall. Leave the syringe. Just go.”
The medical team, seeing the unshakeable certainty in his eyes, hesitated for a moment, then complied. They filed out of the room, leaving only the four of us who had been there for the first ordeal: Cora, me, Casas, and the feral, terrified man crouched against the wall.
The moment the uniforms were gone, the low growl in Jarren’s chest subsided, though his posture remained tense, wary.
Cora took a deep, steadying breath. He slowly, deliberately, took off his own team-issued polo shirt, leaving him in his plain grey undershirt. He was stripping himself of authority, of uniform, becoming just a man.
He held his hands up, palms open, showing they were empty.
“Jarren,” he said, his voice soft, gentle, the voice he had used when Jarren had first broken down. “Mijo. It’s just us now. The doctors are gone. It’s just me. It’s Alex.”
He took a single, slow step across the invisible line.
Jarren flinched, his body tensing, but he didn’t roar. He didn’t throw anything. His wild eyes locked onto Cora’s, and for the first time, a flicker of recognition, of pained confusion, seemed to cut through the feverish haze.
“Alex…?” he whispered, the name a question, a ghost of a memory.
“Yeah, mijo. It’s me,” Cora said, taking another slow step. He was still ten feet away, but he was inside the perimeter. “You’re sick, Jarren. You have a fever. It’s making you see things that aren’t there. But we are here. We are real.”
He kept his voice a low, rhythmic, soothing murmur. “You’re safe. But you’re not well. We have to help you get well. They have to fix your hand. I know it hurts. God, I know. But we have to let them. I won’t let them hurt you more than they have to. I promise.”
He took another step. He was close now. He slowly knelt down, putting himself on Jarren’s level again, just as he had done before.
“I need you to come back to the bed,” Cora said, his voice a soft plea. “I need you to be brave for me one more time. Can you do that? Can you be brave for me?”
He held out his hand. Not to grab, but to offer.
Jarren stared at the outstretched hand, then at Cora’s face. The wildness in his eyes began to recede, replaced by a vast, bottomless ocean of pain and exhaustion. He looked at the hand, then at me and Casas, standing silently by the door. He saw not threats, but the familiar faces of his protectors.
A single, ragged sob escaped his lips. He didn’t take Cora’s hand. He just collapsed forward, into his manager’s waiting arms, the fight completely and utterly gone.
Cora caught him, held him, and helped him stumble back toward the bed. He eased him down, pulling the sheet over him, cradling him like his own son.
I looked at Casas. We both knew what was coming next. We moved to our stations, taking our places on either side of the bed.
I stepped into the hallway. The medical team was waiting, their faces anxious.
“He’s calm,” I said to the specialist. “Alex has him. But we are not using a sedative. Not unless he fights us off again. We are going to try this one more time. You will be as fast and as gentle as you possibly can. We will hold him. You will do your job. Is that clear?”
The doctor, looking shaken but resolute, gave a single, sharp nod.
He and one nurse followed me back into the room. The stage was set for the second attempt. The patient was calm, but the terror was just waiting beneath the surface. We were about to walk back into the fire.
<some debris hide deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <Getting those debris out almost unleashed the wild animal again.><Cora, Triston and Casas managed to calm Jarren down>
<add more details>
<stop before the antiseptic>
The specialist and the nurse moved with the quiet, focused intensity of a bomb squad. They knew they had one chance. The local anesthetic was administered again, the needle pricks earning a series of low, pained moans from Jarren, but he remained pliant in Cora’s arms, his trust placed entirely in his manager.
Schneider, who had returned with the medical team, stood by, his face a grim mask. He wasn’t performing the procedure, but he was there, a familiar presence in the room.
The specialist, armed with a fresh set of forceps and a scalpel, began the second debridement. He worked with a desperate urgency, his movements swift and precise. For the first few minutes, it seemed like it might work. Jarren’s body was tense, his breathing shallow, but he was contained, held in place by our combined presence and Cora’s constant, soothing murmur.
Then, the doctor found it.
“Here’s the problem,” he muttered, his voice tight with concentration. He used the forceps to part a section of the raw muscle tissue. “There’s a pocket. Some fragments of the warning track material, they’re not just on the surface. They’ve been driven deep, underneath the fascia.”
To get them out, he couldn’t just scrape. He had to dig.
The moment the forceps probed into that deeper layer of tissue, a new, horrifying threshold of pain was crossed.
Jarren’s body went rigid, his back arching off the bed with a force that nearly threw us off him. A strangled, guttural scream, a sound of pure, unadulterated agony, ripped from his throat. The wildness flooded back into his eyes. The fever-dream demons were back.
“No… no… get it out!” he roared, his voice a raw, desperate shriek. He began to thrash again, the controlled procedure instantly devolving into a chaotic, desperate struggle.
“Hold him!” the doctor yelled, trying to maintain his position. “Don’t let him move his arm!”
Casas, his face a mask of grim determination, threw his weight onto Jarren’s legs, trying to pin them to the bed. I leaned over his shoulders, trying to keep his torso from bucking. But it was Cora who held the line.
He tightened his embrace, turning Jarren’s face into his chest, muffling the screams against his own body. “I’m here, mijo! I’m right here! Fight me, not them! It’s almost over! ¡Casi terminamos, campeón! ¡Aguanta!” We’re almost done, champion! Hang on!
Jarren’s consciousness was flickering, his screams dissolving into a series of pained, delirious ramblings. He was fighting phantoms, his words a jumbled mess of ballpark curses and childish pleas.
“Get off… can’t breathe… sorry, Dad… make it stop…”
The specialist, seeing his window closing, worked with a frantic, desperate haste. He probed, he pulled, he scraped, extracting one tiny, dark fragment after another. Each removal sent a fresh, violent tremor through Jarren’s body, a new wave of agony that threatened to unleash the feral strength again.
“He’s fighting too hard,” the nurse said, her voice strained as she tried to help hold his arm steady. “His heart rate is spiking!”
“Almost there,” the doctor grunted, his own forehead beaded with sweat. “Just one more piece… it’s deep…”
He made one final, deep probe.
Jarren let out a final, soul-shattering scream and then, as if a switch had been flipped, he went limp. The fight was gone. The thrashing stopped. His body, pushed beyond its absolute limit, had found the only escape it could: it shut down. He was unconscious again, his breathing shallow and ragged.
The doctor quickly extracted the last piece of debris and pulled back, his own hands trembling.
“It’s done,” he said, his voice a hoarse whisper. “It’s clean. For real this time.”
The room was a wreck. The floor was littered with glass and discarded medical supplies. The four of us were panting, sweating, our own bodies aching from the physical and emotional strain of the fight.
We had won. But it felt like a devastating loss.
The specialist looked at the unconscious man on the bed, then at the brown bottle of Betadine on the new tray. He looked at us, his eyes full of a grim, apologetic dread.
The worst part was still to come.
<The fire shot through Jarren’s body even in his half-unconscious state>
<Brought to hell for the second time in 48 hours, he has no fight left>
<He was back to the park>
<He thought this was the punishment for his failures>
<For not swinging the best in the park>
<Not growing up>
<the Tapia inside the park homerun>
<dropping two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that>
<dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again>
<every strikeout>
<every caught stealing>
<every baserunning mistake>
<He apologized, he pleaded, he promised to be good, be better, act like All-Star MVP every night. He promised to do anything, if only the punishment could stop>
<add more details>
The specialist uncapped the Betadine, the sharp, chemical scent instantly filling the room, a harbinger of the agony to come. He soaked a large sterile pad, the dark brown liquid staining it the color of dried blood.
“I’m going to be as fast as I can,” he said, his voice a low, grim promise.
He pressed the soaked pad onto the freshly debrided, raw, and bleeding wound.
Even in his semi-conscious state, Jarren’s body knew the fire. A low, guttural moan rumbled in his chest, and his entire frame went rigid, every muscle locking in a state of excruciating tension. His back arched, his limbs twitched, but there was no fight left. There was no thrashing, no screaming. He had been brought to the gates of hell for the second time in 48 hours, and his body had nothing left to give. He could only endure.
But his mind… his mind fled. It fled the sterile room, the concerned faces, the unbearable present. It fled back to the only place that could make sense of such deliberate, focused pain.
He was back in the park.
His lips began to move, his words a slurred, feverish, heartbreaking confession whispered to the ghosts only he could see.
“S-sorry…” he mumbled, his head thrashing weakly against Cora’s shoulder. “Didn’t… didn’t swing my best… I’m sorry…”
A tremor ran through him as the antiseptic seeped deeper into the wound.
“Not… not growing…” he whispered, the words choked with a child’s shame. “I’m trying… so sorry, Dad…”
His mind, unmoored by fever and agony, began to play a highlight reel of his failures, each one a justification for the torment he was enduring. This was his punishment. He was finally paying for his sins.
“Tapia…” he gasped, his body twitching as he relived the infamous inside-the-park home run. “Didn’t… didn’t get to it… my fault… so sorry…”
The specialist, his face a stone mask of concentration, continued his work, ensuring every millimeter of the wound was saturated.
“Kansas City…” Jarren moaned, his voice cracking. “Dropped two… got mad… shouldn’t have… I’m sorry…”
His breathing grew more ragged, his words tumbling out faster, a torrent of self-flagellation.
“Dove for it… missed… tried to smother it… missed again… let the run score… sorry…”
“Every strikeout… every time… let the team down…”
“Caught stealing… shouldn’t have gone… bad read… my fault…”
“Ran through the stop sign… bad mistake… so sorry…”
The litany was endless. Every error, every misjudgment, every failure, magnified by the fever and validated by the pain. He was a man on a rack, confessing to crimes only he believed he had committed.
Then, the confession turned into a plea. A desperate, frantic bargaining with the specter of his father, the arbiter of his pain.
“Please…” he begged, tears leaking from his closed eyes, tracing paths through the sweat and grime on his face. “I’ll be good. I promise. I’ll be better.”
His voice rose, becoming a high, thin, desperate whine.
“I’ll be an All-Star… every night… I promise… I’ll hit… I’ll run… I’ll do anything… anything…”
He took a shuddering, desperate breath, his final plea a distillation of his entire life’s struggle.
“Please… just… just make the punishment stop.”
And then, as Schneider finally, mercifully, lifted the pad, he went silent. His body went limp, his head lolling to the side, his consciousness finally surrendering completely, a final, blessed escape into the quiet dark.
<imagine other people's reactions><add more details>


The moment the Betadine pad lifted, a collective, silent exhalation of breath filled the room. The air, which had been thick with the sounds of agony and the tension of the struggle, was now heavy with a profound, suffocating stillness. The only sound was the frantic, elevated beep of the heart monitor, a frantic testament to the war that had just been waged.
The specialist, his job finally, truly done, stepped back from the bed, his shoulders slumping. He stripped off his gloves and threw them into the biohazard bin with a gesture of finality and utter exhaustion. He leaned against the wall, his mask still on, but I could see in his eyes that he was shaken to his core. He was a man of science, of medicine, but he had just been a reluctant participant in what felt like a medieval exorcism.
The nurse, her face pale and her own eyes wet, began to work with quiet, trembling hands, applying the soothing ointment and the first layers of clean, white gauze. Her movements were filled with a tenderness that was almost reverent, as if she were dressing the wounds of a fallen soldier.
But my focus was on the men who formed the human shield.
Triston Casas had his back to the bed. He couldn’t look. His massive frame was shaking, his head bowed. He had one hand braced against the wall, the other covering his mouth. He was a young man, full of life and confidence, but he had just stared into the abyss of a teammate’s deepest trauma, and it had broken something in him. He was learning a lesson about the burdens his brothers carried, a lesson that no one should have to learn in such a brutal way.
Alex Cora was still holding Jarren, but his embrace had changed. It was no longer a brace against pain, but a protective, paternal cocoon. He was staring at the far wall, his dark eyes glistening, his jaw clenched with a mixture of sorrow and a cold, hard fury. He had heard every whispered confession, every desperate plea. He had been the father figure Jarren had cried out to, and he had been forced to hold him steady while the punishment was administered. The weight of that contradiction, the sheer, terrible intimacy of it, had settled deep into his bones. He looked ten years older than he had when he’d walked into the room.
And I… I stood frozen, my hand still resting on the empty space on the bed where Jarren’s shoulder had been. I felt cold. A deep, internal cold that had nothing to do with the temperature of the room. I had heard his litany of failures. The Tapia home run. The errors in Kansas City. The baserunning mistakes. These were not just plays to me. They were data points. They were moments I had analyzed, discussed in meetings, factored into decisions. I had treated them as professional missteps, as areas for improvement.
But I had just heard them recited as articles of impeachment against his own soul. I had just witnessed a man who believed, in his deepest, most wounded core, that he deserved to be tortured for striking out.
The chasm between my world of analytics and his world of pain had never been wider, or more terrifying. I had been trying to fix a machine, while he had been trying to absolve a sinner.
In that moment, I understood that my job was not just to build a winning team. It was to build a sanctuary. A place where the ghosts of the past could be laid to rest, where a man’s worth was not measured by his last mistake, and where the only punishment for failure was the grace of a new day, a new game.
The silence stretched on, a heavy shroud over the four of us, each man lost in his own private reckoning, forever changed by the terrible, sacred ordeal we had just shared.
The specialist, after a long moment of leaning against the wall, finally pushed himself upright. He walked over to the small sink in the corner of the room and began to scrub his hands, the sound of the running water a stark, normal intrusion into the heavy silence. He scrubbed with a methodical, almost frantic intensity, as if trying to wash away not just the potential for contamination, but the memory of the last hour.
He dried his hands and turned to face me, pulling his mask down. His face was ashen, his eyes shadowed with a professional weariness that went beyond simple fatigue.
“His vitals are stabilizing,” he said, his voice low, clinical, but with an undercurrent of strain. “The fever hasn’t broken, but it’s not climbing. The next twelve hours will be critical.” He glanced at Jarren’s still form. “I’ve never… in twenty years of practice, I have never seen a patient with that level of systemic stress fight a procedure like that. His pain threshold is… astronomical. And his psychological response…” He trailed off, shaking his head, unable to find the medical terminology for what he had just witnessed.
The nurse, having finished the bandaging, was now quietly and efficiently clearing the last of the debris. Her hands, however, were not steady. A fine tremor ran through them as she gathered the bloodied gauze and discarded instruments. She avoided looking at the bed, her focus entirely on her task, a professional shield against the emotional shrapnel that filled the room.
When she finished, she approached the specialist, her voice a hushed whisper. “Doctor, the sedative is here. The anesthesiologist is on standby. Do you want me to…?”
“No,” the specialist said, cutting her off, his voice firm. “No. We’re not putting anything else into his system unless he becomes a danger to himself again. He’s been through enough.” He looked at me, his eyes conveying a deep, unspoken apology. “We did what we had to do. Now we support the patient. Fluids. Antibiotics. And quiet.”
He turned to the nurse. “Let’s give them some space. Monitor his vitals from the hallway station. Only come in if an alarm sounds or if they call for you.”
The nurse nodded, her eyes full of a compassionate understanding. She gave one last, sad look at Jarren, then at Cora holding him, and quietly slipped out of the room.
The specialist lingered for a moment longer. He looked at the three of us—Cora, Casas, and me—standing our silent, exhausted vigil.
“What he has,” the doctor said, his voice barely above a whisper, “is a textbook case of complex trauma manifesting as a severe anxiety response under extreme physical duress.” He shook his head again. “But that doesn’t even begin to cover it. The strength it must take to live with that every day… it’s unimaginable.”
He looked at me directly, the professional barrier between us dissolving for a moment. “You have a remarkable human being on your team, Mr. Breslow. But he is walking on a knife’s edge. The physical wound will heal. But the other wounds… they’re going to need just as much care.”
With that, he gave a single, weary nod, and followed his nurse out into the hallway, leaving us alone once more in the quiet, sterile, sacred space where a man had been brought to the very brink, only to be held there by the family he had found.
The door clicked shut, leaving the three of us in a silence that was now softer, less charged with immediate crisis. The only sounds were the steady beep of the monitor and Jarren’s deep, even breathing. He was finally, truly at rest.
Triston Casas, who had been a silent, stoic tower of strength, finally let his own exhaustion show. He sank into one of the chairs, running a hand over his face. He looked from Jarren’s peaceful form to Cora, then to me. His young face was etched with a confusion that went beyond the events of the day.
“That park,” Casas said, his voice a low, troubled rumble. “He kept… he kept talking about a park. About getting a hit. About his dad.” He shook his head, trying to make sense of the delirious, heartbreaking confessions. “I don’t… I don’t get it. What was he talking about?”
Cora, still seated on the edge of the bed, gently eased Jarren’s head onto a pillow, finally releasing his embrace. He looked at Casas, his eyes full of a deep, weary sadness. He glanced at me, a silent question. I gave a subtle, almost imperceptible nod. He needs to know. He’s part of this now.
“He was talking about how he learned to play baseball, Triston,” Cora began, his voice low and heavy. He chose his words carefully, translating a lifetime of complex trauma into something another man could understand. “When he was a little kid, his father… his father was hard on him. Very hard. He expected him to be perfect. And when he wasn’t…”
Cora paused, the words catching in his throat. He looked at me, his eyes asking for help.
I stepped forward, pulling the other chair closer to sit with them, forming a small, tight circle. “His father used to take him to a park for batting practice,” I said, picking up the narrative, my voice quiet and measured. “If Jarren didn’t swing the way his dad wanted, if he made a mistake, his father would… he would throw baseballs at him. To punish him. To make him ‘better.’”
Casas’s face, which had been confused, now contorted into a mask of disbelief and horror. “He… what? He hit him? With baseballs?”
“Yes,” I said, my voice flat. “And he told him that if he ran home crying, he was a failure. But he also knew that Jarren’s pride, his drive, was so strong that he would always come back to the park to try again. To prove he wasn’t a failure.”
Cora picked up the story again, his voice filled with a profound, aching empathy. “So that park… it became the place where he learned everything. He learned that pain is a part of the process. He learned that to stop, to rest, is to fail. He learned that love and approval were conditional, that he had to earn them by being perfect, by enduring the punishment.”
I looked at Casas, making sure he was seeing the full, terrible picture. “So what you heard today, Triston… that wasn’t just a fever dream. That was his subconscious. When his body was subjected to that level of pain, his mind went back to the only framework it had to understand it. He thought he was being punished. He thought he was back in the park, begging his dad to stop, promising to be better, promising to get a hit.”
The color drained from Casas’s face. The pieces clicked into place, and the full, horrifying weight of what he had witnessed settled upon him. He looked at Jarren, no longer as just his teammate, but as a survivor of something he could barely comprehend.
“So every day…” Casas whispered, his voice full of a new, terrible understanding. “Every time he plays through something, every time he gets mad at himself for striking out… he’s still that little kid in the park.”
“Yes,” Cora said softly, his hand gently resting on Jarren’s sleeping form. “He is. And our job… our job is to prove to him, every single day, that Fenway is not that park. That we are not his father. That here, his worth is not conditional. That here, he is safe.”
The three of us sat in silence, the shared knowledge a heavy, sacred bond between us. We were no longer just a GM, a manager, and a first baseman. We were the keepers of a story, the guardians of a man’s broken past, and the architects of his future.
<The fever broke. Jarren woke up the next day, still weak, but conscious. He had only vague memories of the two-day fever><add more details><stop the scene before the doctors came to check on Jarren>
The dawn of the fourth day broke with a quiet, tentative hope. The frantic, high-pitched beeping of the heart monitor had settled back into its steady, reassuring rhythm. The fever, which had raged like a wildfire, had finally broken in the pre-dawn hours.
I had been dozing in the uncomfortable chair when the shift happened. It wasn’t a sound that woke me, but a change in the atmosphere of the room. The oppressive heat radiating from Jarren’s body had subsided. His breathing, which had been shallow and rapid, had deepened into the slow, even cadence of true, restorative sleep.
Cora, who had been asleep in the other chair, stirred at the same moment, a manager’s instinct sensing the change in his player. We looked at each other across the dim room, a silent, shared acknowledgment. The crisis had passed.
We let him sleep. The team’s silent vigil continued, though the tense anxiety was replaced by a quiet, hopeful relief. Players on their way to early workouts would poke their heads in, see him sleeping peacefully, and exchange a small, grateful smile with whoever was on duty before moving on.
It was just after 9 a.m. when he finally woke up.
It wasn’t a sudden jolt. It was a slow, gentle drift back to the surface. His eyelids fluttered, then opened. He blinked a few times, his eyes slowly focusing on the unfamiliar ceiling. He turned his head, his movements weak and sluggish.
I was sitting in the chair by his bed, reading scouting reports on my tablet, though I hadn’t absorbed a word in hours. He saw me, and his brow furrowed in a deep, groggy confusion.
“Craig…?” he said, his voice a dry, scratchy whisper. “What… what happened?”
“Hey,” I said softly, putting the tablet aside. I leaned forward, my expression calm and reassuring. “Welcome back. You gave us a bit of a scare.”
He tried to push himself up, then winced, a wave of weakness washing over him. He looked down at his bandaged hand, then at the IV line taped to his other arm. His eyes widened slightly as he took in the medical equipment.
“There was… a fever,” he said, the words more a question than a statement. His memory was a fog, a collection of disjointed, nightmarish images. “I remember… it hurt. A lot.”
“You had a pretty nasty infection,” I explained, my voice even. “The fever got pretty high for a while. The doctors had to go back in and clean out your hand again yesterday.”
He closed his eyes, a flicker of a terrible memory crossing his face. “I… I think I remember that. It’s… blurry. Like a bad dream.” He opened his eyes again and looked at me, a hint of the old shame creeping back in. “Was I… did I…?”
“You were a warrior,” I said, cutting him off before he could ask the question. I chose the word deliberately, reframing it. “You fought like hell. We’re all incredibly proud of you.”
He looked confused, the word ‘proud’ not fitting into the narrative of failure he was trying to piece together from the fragments of his memory.
Just then, the door opened and Cora walked in, a fresh coffee in his hand. He stopped when he saw Jarren was awake, a wide, relieved smile breaking across his tired face.
“Look who’s back with us,” Cora said, his voice warm. He walked over to the bed. “How you feeling, mijo?”
“Weak,” Jarren admitted, his voice still a whisper. “And… confused. What day is it?”
“Monday,” Cora said. “You’ve been mostly out of it for the last two days.”
The reality of the lost time seemed to hit him. He stared at us, then around the small room, at the two chairs with discarded coffee cups, the rumpled blanket on Cora’s chair.
“You guys…” he said, his voice cracking with a dawning, disbelieving understanding. “You’ve been here?”
“Of course,” I said simply. “Where else would we be?”
He stared at us, his eyes welling up. But these weren’t the tears of pain or shame. They were tears of a profound, overwhelming gratitude. He was beginning to understand. Not the details of what had happened, but the fundamental truth of it. He had been at his lowest, his most vulnerable, and he had not been alone.
He opened his mouth to speak, to apologize, to thank us, but just then, the door opened again, and the doctor walked in, a chart in his hand and a look of professional relief on his face.



<Given the scare  yesterday, they were very cautious when approaching Jarren><Jarren was confused><Casas, Craig, Cora made jokes about it><add more details>
The moment the doctor and nurse entered, the atmosphere in the room shifted. They stopped just inside the door, their movements hesitant, their expressions a mixture of professional duty and genuine apprehension. They were remembering the feral, cornered animal from the day before, not the weak, lucid man lying in the bed.
Jarren, seeing them, tensed up. A flicker of a memory, a shadow of the pain and fear, crossed his face. He instinctively tried to pull his bandaged hand closer to his body.
The doctor, noticing the reaction, held up his hands in a placating gesture. “Easy, Jarren,” he said, his voice deliberately calm and slow. “It’s just me. Dr. Evans. We’re just here to check on you. No needles, no scalpels. I promise. We’re just going to look.”
The caution was so thick you could cut it with a knife. They were treating the room like a potential crime scene, their movements slow, their voices low.
Jarren looked from their nervous faces to ours, his confusion deepening. “What’s… what’s wrong with them?” he whispered to Cora. “Why are they acting so weird?”
Cora looked at me, a slow, mischievous grin spreading across his face. The relief of the morning had made him playful. He saw an opportunity.
“Oh, nothing, mijo,” Cora said, his voice laced with mock seriousness. “They’re just a little scared of you. You weren’t exactly a model patient yesterday.”
Jarren’s eyes widened. “What? What did I do?”
Casas, who had just walked in with a tray of breakfast foods, overheard and jumped in, his own face lighting up. “What did you do?” he exclaimed, setting the tray down with a laugh. “Dude, you went full-on werewolf on them! I thought you were going to start climbing the walls. Threw a water pitcher at the doc’s head. Almost gave him a fade.”
“I did what?” Jarren’s face was a mask of horrified disbelief.
“It’s true,” I said, leaning back in my chair and joining the roast, the levity a blessed relief. “I was about to call the zoo to get a tranquilizer gun. We had a whole team of doctors and nurses huddled in the hallway, drawing straws to see who had to come back in here.”
The medical staff, hearing us, began to relax. The nurse stifled a giggle behind her hand. Dr. Evans shook his head, a weary but genuine smile finally breaking through his professional demeanor.
“He’s not exaggerating by much,” the doctor admitted, taking a cautious step closer. “You’ve got a pretty good arm, even with a 103-degree fever.”
Jarren stared at us, utterly mortified. “Oh my God,” he whispered, sinking back into his pillows and covering his face with his good hand. “I am so, so sorry.”
“Hey,” Cora said, his voice turning serious again, but still warm. He patted Jarren’s leg. “You weren’t you. You were sick. And you were fighting. Nobody blames you. We’re just glad you’re back.”
The humor had done its job perfectly. It had taken a terrifying, traumatic event and reframed it. It wasn’t a story of a man losing his mind; it was the story of a sick warrior fighting off a whole hospital. It gave him a narrative he could live with, one of strength rather than shame. It diffused the tension and allowed the doctors to finally approach him not as a threat, but as the patient they were there to heal.
Jarren peeked out from behind his hand, his embarrassment slowly being replaced by a reluctant, sheepish smile. He had no memory of it, but in a strange way, the story of his own delirium was the final, irrefutable proof of how much everyone in that room had been there for him. They had seen him at his absolute worst, and they were still there, laughing with him.
<Jarren wanted some water, Craig reached for the pitcher before realizing it had fullfilled its mission as a grenade the day before><add more details>
Dr. Evans, now able to approach the bed without fear of incoming projectiles, began his examination. He checked Jarren’s vitals, listened to his heart and lungs, and gently palpated the lymph nodes in his neck.
“Well, the fever is down, your heart rate is stabilizing, and you’re lucid,” the doctor announced with satisfaction. “That’s all excellent news. We’ll keep the IV in for another 24 hours just to be safe, but you’re officially out of the woods.”
A collective sigh of relief, the real one this time, filled the room.
“Can I… can I have some water?” Jarren asked, his voice still a dry rasp. “My throat feels like sandpaper.”
“Of course,” I said immediately, turning to the bedside table. “Here, let me get you…”
My hand reached for the spot where the heavy glass water pitcher had been. My fingers met empty air. I stopped, my brain taking a moment to catch up. Then, the memory of the previous day’s chaos hit me, and I looked over at the far wall.
The nurse, following my gaze, pointed to a small trash can in the corner, now lined with a fresh bag. “The remains are in there,” she said with a completely straight face.
I looked back at the bedside table, then at Jarren, and a slow grin spread across my face.
“Ah,” I said, turning back to him. “It seems your primary ammunition source from yesterday’s skirmish has been… decommissioned. It fulfilled its mission with extreme prejudice.”
Jarren’s eyes widened as the realization dawned on him. “Oh, man. I really did that?”
“Did that?” Casas boomed, grabbing a plastic cup and heading for the water cooler in the corner. “Dude, it was a work of art. The velocity, the accuracy… if you miss any time with the hand, we might have a spot for you in the bullpen. Your spin rate on that thing was elite.”
Cora chuckled, shaking his head. “I was about to signal for a lefty-lefty matchup. Figured you had at least two more pitches in you.”
Jarren groaned and sank back into the pillows, the embarrassment warring with a reluctant smile. “I am never going to live this down, am I?”
“Not a chance,” I said, taking the cup of water from Casas and handing it to him. “The ‘Fenway Flier,’ the ‘Cleveland Catapult’… the guys in the marketing department are already workshopping nicknames.”
I was joking, of course, but there was a deeper truth to it. We were taking his moment of terrifying delirium and turning it into a legend, a piece of clubhouse lore. We were transforming a memory of trauma into a story of strength, a story he could own without shame. Every joke was another layer of armor, another way of saying, We saw you at your worst, and we’re still here, and we still love you.
He took a sip of water, his eyes smiling over the rim of the cup. He was weak, he was exhausted, and he was mortified. But for the first time in a long time, surrounded by his strange, dysfunctional, fiercely loyal family, he looked truly, completely safe.
<Doctors suggested Jarren get some food and drink><Jarren had no stomach for anything after two days of fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details>
After Jarren had finished the cup of water, Dr. Evans made his final recommendation. “Alright, the next order of business is getting some calories into you. Your body has burned through a tremendous amount of resources fighting this fever. You need fuel. Broth, toast, yogurt, whatever you can tolerate. But you need to eat.”
At the mention of food, a pale, greenish tint returned to Jarren’s face. He shook his head weakly.
“No,” he whispered, his hand going to his stomach. “I can’t. Nothing. The thought of it…” He swallowed hard, his expression turning grim. “I don’t think anything will stay down.”
“You gotta eat, man,” Casas said, gesturing to the breakfast tray he’d brought in hours ago, which now sat cold and unappetizing. “I got you a bacon, egg, and cheese. It’s a little past its prime, but…”
Jarren groaned and turned his head away, a look of pure nausea on his face.
“Okay, maybe not that,” Casas conceded.
This was the next hurdle. His body needed fuel, but his system, ravaged by fever and stress, was in full rebellion.
Cora, who had been watching quietly, stood up. He had managed players through slumps, through injuries, through personal crises. He knew when to be a friend, when to be a father, and when to be the manager.
“Alright, everybody out,” he said, his voice shifting, taking on the familiar tone of clubhouse authority. “Me and Jarren need a minute. Triston, go get me a cup of chicken broth from the kitchen, and a piece of dry toast. Nothing on it. And a spoon.”
Casas, recognizing the shift in command, nodded and left without a word. I gave Jarren a reassuring look and followed, giving them the space.
We waited in the hallway. A few minutes later, Casas returned with the simple meal. He handed it to Cora at the door. We could hear Cora’s voice, low and steady, through the closed door. It wasn’t the soft, comforting tone from before. It was firm, patient, unyielding. The voice of a manager who knows what his player needs, even when the player doesn’t.
After about fifteen minutes, the door opened. Cora emerged, holding an empty cup and a plate with only a few crumbs on it. He looked tired, but satisfied.
“He ate it,” Cora said, a note of triumph in his voice. “Complained about every single bite. Told me he was going to throw up on my shoes. I told him I’d buy new shoes, but he was finishing the soup.”
He handed the empty dishes to Casas. “He’s resting now. I think he’ll sleep for a while.”
I looked at Cora, a deep respect for his craft settling in. He hadn’t just been a father figure. He had been a coach. He knew that sometimes, the most compassionate thing you can do for a player is to refuse to let them give up on themselves, even on something as simple as a cup of soup. He had forced Jarren to take the first, necessary step on the long road back to recovery.
It was a small victory, but in the quiet aftermath of the war we had just been through, it felt as monumental as winning the pennant.
<Jarren felt much better in the afternoon><He went to the dugout to watch the game.><Teammates joked to him><For the first time, he realized even if he could't contribute, his teammates loved him just the same><add more details>
By late afternoon, the change was remarkable. The food, the fluids, and the long, peaceful sleep had worked a quiet magic. The color returned to Jarren’s face, the deep exhaustion in his eyes replaced by a weary but lucid awareness. He was still weak, but he was himself again.
He insisted on getting out of the medical room, which he now referred to as “the scene of the crime.” Dressed in a fresh team hoodie and sweatpants, he looked less like a patient and more like a player on a scheduled day off.
“I want to watch the game,” he said, his voice still a little rough but firm. “I can’t just lie in here.”
There was no argument. Being with the team was part of the healing process.
He made his way slowly from the training room to the dugout, me and Cora flanking him, a discreet but ever-present honor guard. As he emerged into the familiar space, the players on the bench turned.
The atmosphere was completely different from the day before. The quiet, somber respect was gone, replaced by a relentless, brotherly roast.
“Hey, look who it is!” shouted Bobby Dalbec from the far end of the bench. “Somebody hide the water pitchers!”
“Keep him away from the Gatorade cooler!” Kenley Jansen yelled, a huge grin on his face. “That thing is a deadly weapon in his hands!”
Jarren’s face flushed a deep crimson, but this time it was from embarrassment, not fever. He tried to glower at them, but a reluctant smile tugged at his lips.
He found a spot at the end of the bench, and Devers immediately sat down next to him, draping an arm over his shoulder. “Feeling better, mi loco?” Raffy asked, his voice full of warmth. “You had us worried. We almost had to call in a priest.”
“Shut up, man,” Jarren mumbled, but he leaned into the embrace, a silent acknowledgment of the affection.
Throughout the game, a steady stream of teammates came by. They didn’t ask him how he was feeling. They didn’t talk about the injury. They just included him. They complained about the umpire’s strike zone. They asked his opinion on a pitcher’s new slider. They made him feel like part of the team, even though he couldn’t hold a bat.
And they kept the jokes coming.
When a foul ball clattered into the dugout, Pivetta yelled, “Don’t let Jarren get it! He’ll throw it at the ump!”
When a player was called out on a close play at first, Bregman turned to him and said, with mock seriousness, “You would’ve been safe. And you probably would’ve taken out the first baseman with a flying body slam, but you would’ve been safe.”
Jarren took it all, his initial embarrassment slowly melting away, replaced by something new. A quiet, dawning realization.
He was sitting on the bench, unable to play, unable to contribute. In his mind, he was useless, a liability. In the old framework of his life, this was the ultimate failure. This was when the love, the approval, was supposed to be withdrawn.
But it wasn’t.
He looked at the faces around him—Devers, Bregman, Casas, Cora—all of them laughing and joking with him, treating him with the same easy camaraderie as if he’d just hit a walk-off home run. He wasn’t Jarren Duran the All-Star MVP. He wasn’t Jarren Duran the injured player. He was just JD. Their teammate. Their brother.
For the first time in his entire life, he was experiencing a love that was truly, completely, and undeniably unconditional. It had nothing to do with his performance. It had nothing to do with his toughness. They loved him just for being him.
I watched him from the other end of the dugout, seeing the slow, profound understanding dawn in his eyes. He was smiling, a real, genuine smile that reached all the way to his soul. He was finally, truly, back in the park. But this time, the park was safe. This time, the park was home.
<a split second before the Betadine was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony>
<Letting Cora guide him back to the bed meant accepting the punishment from his father>
<But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment>
<add more details>
As the nurse raised the Betadine-soaked gauze, a horrifying realization dawned in Cora’s eyes. It was a flash of terrible, empathetic insight that turned his face ashen.
He wasn’t just afraid of the pain. He was afraid of what the pain meant.
In Jarren’s fevered, traumatized mind, this entire ordeal—the injury, the confinement, the repeated, deliberate infliction of agony by figures of authority—was not a medical procedure. It was a punishment. It was the park. It was his father, pegging him with baseballs, yelling at him to “be better.”
And Cora, the man he trusted, the man who had just coaxed him out of the corner, had not led him to safety. He had led him back to the place of judgment. By convincing him to return to the bed, Cora had unwittingly played the role of the father, telling him, “I know you will come back,” ready to administer the next round of agonizing “love.”
The trust Jarren had shown was the trust of a boy who had accepted his fate, who had come back to the park to take his punishment because he believed he deserved it.
I saw the understanding shatter across Cora’s face. He looked down at the man he was holding, and his expression was one of utter devastation. He had promised him safety, and he was about to hold him down for the worst torment yet. There was no way back. He couldn’t stop it. The Betadine was necessary. The infection was real.
He was trapped. He had to become the father in the park to save the son.
A single tear escaped the corner of Cora’s eye and traced a path down his temple. He squeezed his own eyes shut for a brief, agonizing moment, a silent apology for the betrayal he was about to commit.
He opened them, his expression now one of grim, heartbreaking resolve. He held Jarren tighter, his embrace no longer just comforting, but a desperate, loving restraint.
“I’m sorry, mijo,” he whispered, the words a ghost meant only for Jarren’s ear. “Forgive me.”
And the nurse pressed the gauze to the wound.
The scream that followed was different. It was not the raw, animalistic shriek of before. It was a sound of pure, soul-deep betrayal. It was the cry of a child whose last hope had just been extinguished.
Jarren’s body went rigid, then convulsed, but he didn’t fight us this time. He didn’t thrash. He just surrendered to the agony, his body a vessel for a pain he now believed he was meant to endure. He was taking his punishment.
His eyes, wide and full of a terrible, lucid despair, were locked on Cora’s face. He was staring directly into the eyes of the man who had led him back to hell.
The nurse worked with a desperate speed, her hands trembling slightly as she covered the entire wound with the searing liquid. The room was filled with the sound of Jarren’s broken, weeping cries and the low, steady murmur of Cora’s voice, repeating the same two words over and over again, a mantra of love and apology.
“I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I’m sorry…”
It was the longest ten seconds of my life. It was an eternity spent in a small, private hell, watching a good man hold down a boy he loved, inflicting a necessary pain that felt like a mortal sin. We were all complicit, our hands stained by a therapeutic violence that felt anything but. We were saving his life by breaking his heart.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 48 hours, Jarren has no fight left>
<He was back to the park>
<He thought this was the punishment for his failures>
<For not swinging the best >
<Not growing up>
<the Tapia inside the park homerun>

<dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again>
<struck out with the bases loaded>
<caught stealing with Raffy at the plate>
<add more details>
The searing agony of the Betadine was a key, unlocking a Pandora’s box of every failure, every mistake, every moment of shame he had ever experienced. His body, too exhausted to fight, went limp in our arms. But his mind, his soul, was back in the park, standing before the unforgiving judge of his own memory.
He didn’t scream anymore. He just wept, a quiet, continuous, heartbreaking stream of tears that soaked the front of Cora’s shirt. And he began to confess.
His voice was a low, slurred, fever-dream murmur, a litany of his sins, each one a reason for the punishment he was now enduring.
“Didn’t… didn’t swing right…” he whispered, his body twitching. “Dad was right… gotta be better…”
The nurse, her own face streaked with tears, began to apply the cooling, soothing ointment, but Jarren didn’t feel it. He was lost in the past.
“Too small…” he mumbled, the words thick with a lifetime of shame. “Didn’t grow… sorry… I’m sorry…”
Cora held him, his own eyes squeezed shut, absorbing every word like a blow. This was the true poison, the infection that no antibiotic could touch.
“Tapia…” Jarren choked out, the name of the player who had hit an inside-the-park home run against him. “Didn’t… didn’t get to the wall fast enough… my fault… let everyone down…”
The nurse started wrapping the hand in soft, clean gauze, each layer a gentle absolution he couldn’t feel.
“Kansas City…” he whispered, his voice cracking. “The sun… lost two… they were yelling… I yelled back… I was bad… so bad…” He was conflating two separate failures into one singular, unforgivable sin. The dropped balls and the arguments with fans, all tangled together.
“Dove for it… missed…” he continued, his mind jumping from one failure to the next. “Tried to smother it… rolled away… everyone scored… my fault…”
His breathing hitched, a sob catching in his throat.
“Bases loaded… struck out… shoulda got a hit…”
He was a man drowning in a sea of his own imperfections, each memory a wave pulling him further under.
“Raffy was up…” he murmured, his voice fading to a near-whisper as the exhaustion and the relief from the ointment began to pull him toward unconsciousness. “Got thrown out… shouldn’t have gone… Raffy woulda… woulda won it…”
His confession slowed, the words slurring into incoherence. He had emptied himself of every failure he could recall. He had paid his penance. He had taken the punishment for every sin, real or imagined.
As the nurse taped the final piece of gauze in place, Jarren’s body finally, truly, surrendered. His head grew heavy on Cora’s shoulder. His breathing deepened, evening out into the slow, steady rhythm of a deep, profound, and merciful sleep.
The ordeal was over. The wound was clean. The fever would break.
But the four of us left awake in that room knew, with a terrible, shared certainty, that the deepest wounds had only just been exposed. And the real healing had yet to begin.
<a split second before the Betadine was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony>
<Letting Cora guide him back to the bed meant willing to accept the punishment from his father>
<But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment>
<add more details>
<stay in the process of antiseptic>
As the nurse raised the Betadine-soaked gauze, a horrifying realization dawned in Cora’s eyes. It was a flash of terrible, perfect clarity. He looked down at the man he was holding, at the way Jarren had surrendered to him, and he finally understood.
It wasn’t just the pain Jarren was afraid of. It was the meaning of the pain.
In his fevered, delirious mind, this room, this procedure, was not a hospital. It was the park. The doctors in their white coats were not healers; they were avatars of his father, the source of the agony. And letting Cora, his manager, his father-figure, lead him back to the bed… that was the act of a child willingly walking back to the place of his punishment. He had surrendered. He had agreed to take what was coming to him, because it was the only way he knew how to process a pain this deliberate, this focused. He was accepting the punishment for every mistake, for not being good enough.
Cora’s face contorted in a silent scream of understanding. He was trapped. He had used his bond, his trust, to lead Jarren back into the fire. He had become part of the nightmare. And now, there was no way out. He couldn’t let go. He had to hold him still. He had to become the enforcer of the punishment his player’s broken mind believed he deserved.
The gauze touched the wound.
The scream that followed was different. It was not the raw, animalistic shriek of before. It was a sound of pure, soul-deep betrayal. It was the cry of a child whose last hope had been extinguished.
Jarren’s body went rigid, then convulsed, but the fight was different. It was weaker, more desperate. He wasn’t trying to escape the room anymore. He was trying to escape Cora’s arms. He twisted, his head whipping around, his eyes, wide with agony and a terrible, dawning lucidity, locking onto Cora’s face.
“You promised,” he gasped, the words a ragged, heartbroken accusation. “You promised.”
Cora’s own face was a mask of torment. Tears streamed freely down his cheeks as he held the man who was now fighting him, who now saw him as the ultimate betrayer. “I’m sorry, mijo,” he choked out, his voice breaking. “I’m so sorry. Forgive me.”
He held on, his grip like iron, his heart shattering into a million pieces.
The nurse worked with frantic speed, her hands trembling but her purpose absolute. She swabbed the entire wound, the Betadine staining the raw flesh a dark, angry brown. Each touch sent a fresh wave of convulsions through Jarren’s body, each one a new accusation, a new betrayal.
He stopped screaming words. He just screamed. A long, unbroken, high-pitched sound of a soul being torn apart. He was no longer fighting the pain. He was just enduring it, lost in the certainty that this was his penance, a punishment delivered by the hands of the man he trusted most.
I held his shoulders, my own body shaking, my mind reeling from the psychological horror unfolding before me. Casas had his eyes squeezed shut, his face a grimace of shared pain, his hands holding Jarren’s legs still.
The nurse finally, finally, pulled the gauze away.
The screaming stopped, cut off into a series of ragged, hitching gasps. Jarren went limp again, all the fight, all the life, draining out of him. He slumped against Cora, a dead weight.
But this time, he didn’t pass out. His eyes remained open, staring blankly at the wall. They were empty. Vacant. The light that had been there—the fire, the fear, even the pain—was gone. All that was left was a profound, hollow emptiness.
The betrayal was complete. The punishment had been delivered. And the boy who had been led back to the park had finally, completely, broken.
<a split second before the Betadine was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony> <Letting Cora guide him back to the bed meant willing to accept the punishment from his father>
<He just permitted Cora to lead him back to the park. He was willing to accept his punishment>
 <But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment> <add more details> <keep the scene in the antiseptic process. I’ll provide more details>
The air grew thick with a terrible, silent understanding. As the nurse raised the Betadine-soaked gauze, a horrifying realization dawned in Cora’s eyes. It was a moment of dreadful clarity, a sudden, intuitive leap into the heart of Jarren’s fevered delirium.
He understood.
It wasn’t just the pain Jarren feared. It was the meaning of the pain. In his shattered, feverish mind, this level of agony, this deliberate infliction of torment, could only be comprehended through one lens: the park. This was the punishment. This was his father, angry, yelling “Be better!”, pegging him with baseballs.
And Cora, by coaxing him back to the bed, by promising safety, had inadvertently become the father leading his son back to the place of his torment. Jarren’s surrender, his pliancy, wasn’t just trust. It was a child’s resignation. He had permitted Cora to lead him back to the park. He was willingly accepting his punishment, because the man he trusted, the father figure, had told him it was necessary.
The weight of that realization was crushing. Cora’s face, for a split second, was a mask of pure, horrified anguish. He had used his bond, his love, to lead this kid back into his own personal hell. And now, there was no way back. He couldn’t stop it. To stop now would be to abandon him in the middle of the nightmare. He had to see it through. He had to become the father who holds his son down, not for punishment, but for healing, even if the son can’t tell the difference.
He held Jarren tighter, his embrace no longer just comforting, but fiercely, desperately protective, as if he could shield him from the memories even as his body endured the pain.
The nurse touched the gauze to the wound.
The scream that followed was different from before. It was not the raw, animalistic shriek of surprise. It was a sound of pure, soul-deep betrayal. It was the cry of a child who had trusted, and had been hurt anyway.
Jarren’s body went rigid, then convulsed, a violent, thrashing agony. But this time, he wasn’t fighting to get away. He was fighting the memory.
“I’m sorry!” he screamed, the words torn from him, his face buried in Cora’s chest. “I’m sorry, Daddy! I’ll be better! I’ll be better!”
He was begging for forgiveness. He was accepting the punishment, convinced he deserved it.
Cora’s own body was shaking, his eyes squeezed shut, tears streaming down his face. He was absorbing every scream, every apology, every tremor of pain. “No, mijo, no,” he whispered, his voice cracking, a desperate, useless mantra against the tide of delirium. “You did nothing wrong. You are good. You are strong.”
But Jarren couldn’t hear him. He was lost in the park, the scent of Betadine the smell of freshly cut grass, the sting on his hand the impact of a thrown baseball.
Casas and I held on, our own faces grim masks of shared trauma. We were no longer just restraining a player. We were anchors, trying to hold a soul to the present, to keep it from being swept away entirely by the ghosts of the past. We were participants in a terrible, necessary exorcism.
The nurse worked with a desperate speed, her hands trembling but her purpose firm. She painted the entire wound with the dark, searing liquid, her own face pale and strained. Each stroke of the gauze was a fresh wave of torment, a fresh cry of apology from the man-child in Cora’s arms.
The room was a crucible, burning away everything but the raw, elemental forces of pain, love, and memory. And we were all being forged in its fire.

<keep the scene in the antiseptic process. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
The fight was gone. There was no strength left for thrashing, no air left for screams. All that remained was a deep, continuous, shuddering moan and a torrent of whispered, fevered confessions. He was utterly broken, a soul laid bare.
He was back in the park, and this time, he knew why he was there. The searing pain in his hand was the righteous punishment for a lifetime of inadequacy.
“Didn’t… didn’t swing right…” he mumbled into Cora’s shirt, his body twitching with the memory of a missed pitch. “Sorry… I know… gotta be better…”
The nurse, her own eyes now swimming with tears, continued her terrible, merciful work. She had to cover every millimeter.
“So small…” he whispered, a sound of pure self-loathing. “Didn’t grow… tried, Daddy… I tried…” The agony of his own physical being, the first and deepest wound of all, came pouring out.
Cora rocked him, his own heart breaking with every word. “You’re big enough, mijo,” he whispered, a desperate counter-narrative against the ghosts. “Eres un gigante.” You are a giant.
But Jarren was deaf to it. He was trapped in his own personal highlight reel of failure.
“Tapia…” he groaned, his body going rigid as he relived the infamous inside-the-park home run. “Didn’t… didn’t get to it… let everyone down… my fault… all my fault…”
The nurse moved to the outer edges of the wound, the pain radiating outwards.
“Kansas City…” he choked out, the memory of dropping two fly balls and then engaging with the fans a fresh wave of shame. “The sun… no excuse… I was bad… so bad… then I got mad… sorry…”
He was confessing to us, to his father, to the universe. Each failure was a brand, and the Betadine was the heat that made them visible.
“The dive…” he gasped, his breathing shallow. “Missed it… tried to smother it… looked like a fool… everyone laughing…”
The nurse, her task almost complete, began the final, careful application around the most sensitive edges.
“Bases loaded…” he whispered, his voice barely audible now. “Struck out… let the team down…”
His body gave a final, violent jerk.
“Raffy was up…” he cried, a thin, reedy sound of pure regret. “Got thrown out… shoulda stayed… Raffy woulda… my fault…”
He was confessing the sins of the old timeline, the one that never happened here, the failures so deep they were embedded in his very soul, regardless of which reality he inhabited.
The nurse finally, mercifully, pulled the gauze away. The wound was a dark, sterile, glistening brown. The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and sorrow.
Jarren’s litany of failure faded into a series of low, exhausted whimpers. His body, having confessed its sins and received its penance, went completely limp in Cora’s arms. The convulsions ceased. The tremors quieted. All that was left was the shallow, ragged breathing of a man who had been dragged to hell and back, twice, in less than 48 hours. He had nothing left.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 48 hours, Jarren has no fight left>
<He was back to the park>
<He thought this was the punishment for his failures>
<For not swinging the best >

<the antiseptic process continues>
The fight was gone. There was no strength left for thrashing, no air left for screams. All that remained was a deep, continuous, shuddering moan and a torrent of whispered, fevered confessions. He was no longer in the room; he was adrift in a river of his own perceived failures, each drop of Betadine a fresh current pulling him deeper.
He was back in the park, a small boy, and the sting on his hand was the punishment for not swinging his best.
“Shoulda… shoulda leveled it out…” he mumbled into Cora’s shirt, his body twitching. “Too much… uppercut… sorry…”
The nurse, her own eyes now wet with tears, continued her work, her movements swift and sure. She had to cover every millimeter. The pain was relentless, a constant, searing fire.
His mind, seeking a reason for this endless torment, latched onto the next sin. The original sin.
“Not… not growing…” he whispered, the words a ghostly echo of a childhood shame. “Tried… so hard… not my fault… sorry, Dad…”
Cora held him tighter, his own heart breaking with every word. “No, mijo, no,” he murmured, a useless prayer against the ghosts.
The nurse moved to the outer edges of the wound, the antiseptic now touching skin that was merely inflamed, not raw. But to Jarren’s hypersensitive nerves, it was a new form of torture. His mind dredged up another failure, another moment of public humiliation.
“Tapia…” he gasped, his body going rigid as he relived the inside-the-park home run. “Shoulda… shoulda got to it… let you down… let everyone down…”
He was confessing to us, to his teammates, to the world. Each memory was a fresh log on the fire of his agony.
“Kansas City…” he choked out, his voice cracking. “The sun… lost two… two balls… shouldn’t have… shouldn’t have yelled at them… the fans… I’m sorry…”
He was reliving the moments that led to his first breakdown, the shame of his performance intertwined with the shame of his reaction.
The nurse, her task almost complete, began the final, meticulous pass. The pain, somehow, intensified.
“The dive…” he cried, a fresh wave of tears tracking through the grime on his face. “Missed it… tried to smother it… got away… everyone scored…”
He was a drowning man, and the water was made of his own mistakes.
“Bases loaded…” he whispered, his voice fading to a raw, scraped sound. “Struck out… let the team down…”
His body gave a final, violent jerk as the nurse applied the last, merciful swipe of Betadine.
“Raffy…” he breathed, the name a final, exhausted apology. “Shouldn’t have… shouldn’t have run… he woulda… woulda drove me in…”
And then, silence.
The nurse stepped back, her work finally, truly, done. The wound was a dark, sterile, angry brown. The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and the sound of four men’s ragged breathing.
Jarren lay limp in Cora’s arms, his litany of failure complete. He had paid his penance. He had endured the punishment for every sin he had ever recorded in the ledger of his soul. He was empty. He was quiet. He was still.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 48 hours, Jarren has no fight left>
<He was back to the park>
<He thought this was the punishment for his failures>

<the antiseptic is far from finished>
The fight was gone. The thrashing ceased. All that was left was a deep, continuous, agonized shudder. Jarren’s body had surrendered completely, leaving his mind naked and defenseless against the onslaught of memory, each wave of pain from the Betadine triggering a new, ghostly failure. He was no longer in the room; he was on a tour of his own personal hell, with his father as the guide.
He lay limp in Cora’s arms, his head thrown back, his eyes half-open and vacant, whispering a disjointed, heartbreaking confession to the ceiling.
“Didn’t… didn’t swing right…” he mumbled, his body twitching as the nurse dabbed a particularly sensitive spot. “Sorry… I know… be better…” He was a boy at batting practice, flinching from the sting of a thrown ball.
Another touch of the gauze. A low, guttural moan.
“So small…” he whispered, the words catching in his throat. “Tried… tried to grow… sorry…” The shame of his own body, a wound deeper than the one on his hand.
The nurse, her own eyes now wet with tears, continued her terrible, necessary work, her movements as swift as she could make them.
“Tapia…” Jarren gasped, his body going rigid as he relived the infamous inside-the-park home run. “Shoulda… shoulda got to it… didn’t… didn’t hustle… let everyone down… I’m sorry…”
He was a player being crucified by his own memory, each sin called forth by a fresh wave of fire on his skin.
“Kansas City…” he choked out, his head thrashing from side to side on Cora’s shoulder. “Two… dropped two… sun wasn’t… no excuse… fans were right… they were right…” He was back in that moment of public failure, the heckles of the crowd a fresh torment.
Cora held him tighter, his own face a mask of anguish, whispering a constant, desperate stream of comfort that Jarren could not hear. “No, mijo, no… you are enough… eres suficiente…”
The nurse moved to a new section of the wound, her touch sending another jolt through his system.
“Dove for it…” he panted, his breathing shallow. “Missed it… tried to smother it… got away… everyone scored… my fault…”
He was cataloging every failure, every imperfection, convinced that this agony was the penance he had earned. This was the price for not being perfect.
“Bases loaded…” he whispered, his voice barely audible now, a dry, rasping sound. “Struck out… let the team down…”
Another memory. Another failure. Another wave of pain.
“Raffy was up…” he mumbled, his body going limp again. “Got caught… shouldn’t have gone… Raffy woulda… my fault… always my fault…”
He was a man drowning in a sea of his own perceived inadequacies, each one a stone pulling him deeper. The antiseptic wasn’t just a chemical; it was a catalyst, transforming physical agony into a spiritual reckoning.
We were no longer just holding him down. We were bearing witness to a confession. We were priests in a sterile, fluorescent hell, listening to a man purge a lifetime of pain, one terrible memory at a time. And the antiseptic, the source of all this torment, was still far from finished.
<He apologized, he pleaded,sometimes speaking like a grown-up, sometimes like a child>
<He promised to be good, be better, act like All-Star MVP every night>
<He swear he would do anything, if only the punishment could stop>
<add more details>
<the finishing line is closer, but still a long way to go>
The line between the man and the child blurred, then vanished completely. His voice, raw and broken, shifted in pitch and cadence, one moment the slurred baritone of the exhausted athlete, the next the high, pleading tenor of a terrified little boy.
“I’m sorry for my temper,” he mumbled, the words of a 26-year-old man confessing to his manager. “The fan… I shouldn’t have… I’ll control it… I promise…”
A fresh wave of Betadine. The man disappeared. The child cried out.
“I’ll clean my room!” he yelped, his voice cracking, his body curling tighter against Cora. “I’ll do my homework! I won’t talk back! Please! Please, Daddy, no more!”
It was a dizzying, heartbreaking vertigo for those of us holding him. We were trying to comfort a man while listening to the pleas of a child who had been dead for twenty years, resurrected by pain.
“I’ll be an All-Star,” he bargained with the ghosts, his voice gaining a desperate, manic energy. “MVP every night. I swear. I’ll hit .300. I’ll steal 50 bases. I’ll win a Gold Glove. Whatever you want. I’ll be whatever you want me to be.”
He was offering up his future, his talent, his entire being as a sacrifice on the altar of his pain, hoping to appease the angry god of his memory.
The nurse, her own face a stoic, tear-streaked mask, continued her work. She was nearing the edges now, the final perimeter. But it was a large wound. The finishing line was in sight, but it was a long, agonizing crawl to get there.
“Anything,” he sobbed, the word a desperate, final plea. “I’ll do anything. Just… just make it stop. Please. I can’t… I can’t take it anymore. I’ll be good. I swear I’ll be good.”
He was no longer just apologizing for his failures. He was apologizing for his very existence. For not being strong enough, for not being tough enough, for not being able to endure the unendurable. He was convinced that this torment was his fault, a punishment he had earned through a lifetime of imperfection.
Cora, his own voice gone, just held him, his cheek pressed against Jarren’s hair, his body absorbing the tremors. Casas had his eyes squeezed shut, his jaw clenched, his hand a white-knuckled vise on Jarren’s leg. I kept my hand on his back, the steady circles the only prayer I could offer, a desperate, silent plea for mercy.
We were in the deepest part of the inferno now, the heat at its most intense. The end was closer, but every second felt like an eternity, each dab of the gauze a fresh lash on a soul that was already flayed raw.
<Jarren finally gave up on negotiations>
<He just endured it, fully accepted his punishment, more convinced than ever he deserved  that.>
<He sobbed into Cora’s shoulders. In his mind, the only way to redeem himself is by taking the punishment>
<add more details>
<the antiseptic finally ends>
The bargaining stopped. The pleas faded. A new, more terrible phase began.
Acceptance.
A profound, chilling stillness settled over Jarren. The frantic energy, the desperate negotiations with his ghosts—it all drained away, leaving behind a hollow, limp vessel. He stopped fighting the memories. He stopped trying to escape. He simply… endured.
He slumped fully into Cora’s arms, a dead weight, his face buried deep in his manager’s shoulder. The only sound he made now was a low, continuous, heartbreaking whimper, the sound of a soul that has accepted its damnation. He was convinced now, more than ever, that this was what he deserved. This was the price. This was the only path to redemption. To take the punishment. To absorb the pain. To prove, in this final, terrible way, that he could be the man his father wanted him to be: one who could take it.
The room grew heavy with the weight of his surrender. It was, in its own way, more horrifying than the screaming. The screaming was a fight. This was a crucifixion.
The nurse, her own movements now almost robotic, worked on the final edges of the wound. Each touch of the Betadine sent a deep, shuddering tremor through Jarren’s body, but he made no other sound. He just whimpered and sobbed quietly into Cora’s shoulder, a child accepting his fate.
Cora held him, his own body rigid with a grief and rage that had no outlet. He was no longer just a comfort; he was a witness, a silent, unwilling accomplice to this terrible, necessary act. He was the father who had to hold his son still for the pain that would save him, knowing the son believed it was the pain that would redeem him.
Finally, after an eternity that stretched and warped time, the nurse pulled the gauze away for the last time. She dropped it into the biohazard bag with a soft, final thud.
She looked at the specialist, her eyes hollow. “It’s done,” she whispered, her voice cracking.
The word hung in the air, a declaration of victory that felt like a profound defeat.
The antiseptic was finished. The fire was out. The room was filled with the silence of the ashes.
<Cora held Jarren, rocked him, soothed him, told him it wasn't a punishment, he hadn't done anything wrong, until Jarren cried himself to sleep>
<add more details>
The silence that followed the nurse’s declaration was absolute, broken only by the soft, rhythmic beep of the heart monitor and the sound of Jarren’s ragged, exhausted weeping. The immediate, searing agony of the Betadine began to recede, leaving behind a deep, throbbing, all-consuming ache.
Cora didn’t let go. He held on tighter, as if trying to physically transfer his own strength, his own conviction, into Jarren’s depleted body. He began to rock him, a slow, gentle, rhythmic motion, like a father rocking a colicky infant.
“Shhh, mijo,” Cora whispered, his voice a low, powerful current of pure love, a direct counter-current to the toxic tide of Jarren’s self-hatred. “It’s over. It’s all over. The pain is done.”
Jarren just sobbed, his face still buried, his body trembling with the aftershocks.
“Listen to me, Jarren,” Cora said, his voice gaining a fierce, desperate intensity. He was no longer just comforting; he was trying to rewrite the narrative, to heal the deeper wound. “That was not a punishment. Do you hear me? That was not a punishment.”
He pulled back just enough to look at Jarren’s tear-streaked face, forcing the younger man to meet his gaze.
“You did nothing wrong,” Cora said, his eyes boring into Jarren’s, willing him to understand. “Striking out is not a sin. Dropping a fly ball is not a crime. Not being big enough is not your fault. None of it. That was medicine, mijo. That was to heal you. That was to save you. It was not a punishment, because you have nothing to be punished for.”
Jarren just stared at him, his exhausted mind struggling to grasp the words. They were a foreign language, a concept from a world he had never known. He shook his head, a fresh wave of sobs wracking his body. The ingrained belief that he deserved this, that this was his penance, was too deep, too powerful.
Cora pulled him back into the embrace, his resolve hardening. He would not let this stand. He would fight the ghosts himself.
“You are good,” Cora murmured, his voice a steady, rhythmic chant against Jarren’s ear. “You are a good man, Jarren. You are a good teammate. You are a good son. You are strong. You are brave. You are enough. You have always been enough.”
He kept repeating it, over and over, a litany of truth against a lifetime of lies. He rocked him, soothed him, his voice a constant, unwavering presence in the quiet room.
Casas and I stood back, silent witnesses to this profound act of love. We were watching a man’s soul being rebuilt, one gentle word at a time.
Slowly, gradually, the storm inside Jarren began to quiet. The wracking sobs softened into shuddering breaths. The rigid tension in his body began to melt away, replaced by a profound, bone-deep exhaustion. His weeping became the quiet, hiccupping cries of a child who has finally exhausted all his tears.
He didn’t fight it anymore. He didn’t argue. He just listened, letting the words wash over him, a gentle tide against the shores of his pain.
Finally, his breathing deepened. His body went limp in Cora’s arms, the last of his strength surrendering not to pain, but to the overwhelming exhaustion of body and soul.
He had cried himself to sleep, held safely in the arms of a man who was desperately trying to teach him what unconditional love felt like.
<ointment and bandage>
<imagine the reaction of Craig and Casas>
<add more details>
With Jarren finally lost in the mercy of sleep, a profound, sacred stillness settled over the room. Cora continued to hold him for a long moment, ensuring the peace was real, before gently, carefully, laying him back against the pillows. He tucked a blanket around him with a tenderness that was breathtaking to behold.
Schneider, who had been waiting with a saint’s patience, stepped forward. His movements were now hushed, reverent. He worked in near silence, applying the thick, cooling layer of silver sulfadiazine cream to the brutalized, Betadine-stained wound. There was no flinching this time, no reaction at all from the man in the bed. The contrast was jarring, a testament to the depths of his exhaustion.
As Schneider began to wrap the hand in soft, clean layers of gauze, I finally allowed myself to move. I felt a hundred years old. I walked over to where Triston Casas was still leaning against the wall, his big frame slumped, his face pale.
He looked at me, his eyes, usually so full of easygoing humor, were haunted.
“Is this… is this what it takes?” he asked, his voice a low, shaky whisper. “To be great? Is this the price?”
I looked from his young, shaken face to the sleeping form of Jarren Duran, then back. I thought of the woman, of her stories, of the terrible, beautiful, and tragic arc of a life I had just witnessed.
“No,” I said, my voice hoarse but certain. “This is the price of a pain that has nothing to do with baseball. This is what happens when a man’s foundation is built on the belief that he is not enough.”
I put a hand on his shoulder. It was trembling slightly.
“What you saw in here today, Triston,” I continued, my voice low and intense, “was not the price of greatness. It was the cost of trauma. And what you did in here today… holding him, supporting him, being his brother… that is how we begin to heal it. That is how we build a new foundation.”
He nodded slowly, processing the words, his eyes still fixed on Jarren. “When he was… when he was talking about the park… about his dad…” He trailed off, unable to finish the sentence.
“I know,” I said softly. “I know.”
We stood there in silence for a long moment, two men from different generations, with vastly different roles on this team, bound by a shared, terrible, and transformative experience. We were no longer just a GM and a first baseman. We were witnesses. We were part of the shield.
Schneider finished his work, taping the final layer of gauze securely. He quietly packed his supplies and gave a single, exhausted nod to Cora before slipping out of the room, leaving the four of us in a silent tableau of aftermath.
Cora pulled a chair to the bedside, sinking into it like a man whose bones had turned to lead. He never took his eyes off Jarren.
I looked at Casas. “Go,” I said gently. “Get some air. Get some food. We’ve got him.”
He looked like he wanted to argue, to stay, but he was too drained. He gave a final, long look at Jarren, then nodded and walked slowly out of the room, leaving me and Cora alone with our sleeping charge.
I looked at the man in the bed, at the steady, rhythmic rise and fall of his chest. He was safe. He was clean. He was, for the first time in a long time, at peace.
The cost had been immense. But as I looked at the quiet strength on Alex Cora’s face, as I remembered the fierce loyalty in Triston Casas’s eyes, I knew, with an unshakeable certainty, that the foundation we were building would be strong enough to bear it. We would not let him fall again.
<ointment and bandage> <imagine the reaction of the medical staff> <add more details>
With Jarren finally succumbing to a deep, healing sleep in Cora’s arms, a fragile peace settled over the room. The air, which had been thick with screams and tension, was now filled with a quiet, shared exhaustion.
Cora continued to hold him for a long moment, ensuring the sleep was real, before gently, carefully, easing him back against the pillows. He tucked a blanket around him with a tenderness that was profoundly moving.
Only then did the medical team move back in. They did so with a reverence and quiet that was more suited to a cathedral than a clinic. They were no longer just treating a patient; they were caring for a survivor.
The specialist, Dr. Alpert, his own face pale and drawn, stepped forward. He looked at the sleeping man, then at the rest of us. “I’ve been a doctor for thirty years,” he said, his voice low and heavy with emotion. “I have never seen a patient endure something like that. His pain tolerance… his will… it’s extraordinary.”
He turned to Schneider. “Let’s get him comfortable.”
Schneider, who had been silently preparing his station, nodded. He worked with a new, almost worshipful gentleness. He took the tube of silver sulfadiazine cream, the cooling balm, and began to apply it to the brutalized, Betadine-stained wound. His touch was as light as a feather. There was no clinical detachment in his movements now; there was only a deep, compassionate desire to soothe the pain he had been forced to inflict.
The head nurse, the one who had applied the antiseptic, stepped forward to help. Her hands, which had been so firm and steady, now trembled slightly. She avoided looking at Jarren’s face, her focus entirely on the task at hand, as if she couldn’t bear to see the peaceful result of such a violent process. She assisted Schneider in placing the large, non-adherent pad over the thick layer of ointment.
As they began to wrap the hand in soft, clean layers of gauze, their movements were a stark contrast to the earlier, desperate procedures. This was an act of restoration. Each layer was a promise of healing, a symbol of protection. They worked in a hushed, coordinated silence, their professionalism now imbued with a profound, shared humanity. They had been participants in a trauma, and it had marked them, too.
When the hand was finally encased in a thick, pristine white bandage, Schneider gently placed it on a fresh pillow by Jarren’s side, elevating it carefully.
Dr. Alpert checked the IV drip, adjusting the flow. He looked at the heart monitor, its rhythm now slower, steadier. “The fever is already starting to break,” he said, a note of weary relief in his voice. “We got it. We got the source.”
He turned to me, Cora, and Casas. “What you three did… holding him, talking him through… that was as important as any medicine we administered. You kept him grounded. Thank you.”
We just nodded, too emotionally drained to speak.
The nurses finished their work, quietly packing away the remnants of the battle, cleaning the room, restoring a sense of order. They moved with a quiet dignity, their faces etched with a mixture of professional pride and personal sorrow. They had done their job, but they would not soon forget the cost. They were healers who had been forced to wield pain as their primary tool, and the experience had left its mark. They would talk about this day for years to come, the day they saw the true limits of human endurance, and the power of a team to hold a man together when he was falling apart.
<imagine the reaction of Cora, Casas and Craig><add more details>
With the medical team’s work complete and Jarren finally lost in a deep, exhausted sleep, the three of us—Cora, Casas, and I—retreated, drawn together by an unspoken need. We didn’t go far. We just moved to the far corner of the room, near the door, as if standing guard. The adrenaline had vanished, leaving a hollow, aching void in its place.
Alex Cora leaned his head back against the wall, closing his eyes. His face, usually so animated and intense, was a pale, drawn mask of utter emotional depletion. His knuckles were red and swollen from where Jarren had crushed his hand, but he didn’t seem to notice. The physical pain was a distant echo of the psychic wounds he had just endured. He had been the father, the anchor, the one who had to absorb the full, terrible force of Jarren’s agony and despair. He had held the boy who was screaming for his own daddy, and the weight of that surrogate role had cost him dearly. He looked ten years older than he had that morning.
Triston Casas, the gentle giant, had slumped into a chair, his massive frame looking small and vulnerable. He stared at the floor, his hands clasped loosely between his knees, his expression one of stunned, heartbroken disbelief. He had come to this team a young, talented player, full of the easy confidence of youth. In the last 48 hours, he had been given a brutal, accelerated education in the true nature of pain, loyalty, and brotherhood. He had seen the darkest corners of a teammate’s soul, had helped hold him together while he shattered. The boyish light in his eyes had been extinguished, replaced by a new, somber maturity. He had witnessed a trauma that would forever change his understanding of what it means to be a teammate, and a man.
And I… I stood with my arms crossed, my shoulder resting against the doorframe, watching over them all. I felt a profound, gut-wrenching mixture of failure and fierce, protective pride. I had failed to protect Jarren from this ordeal. My protocols, my plans, they had all been insufficient in the face of such a catastrophic infection. But the culture… the foundation I had hoped to build… it had held. It had been tested by a fire I could never have imagined, and it had held.
I looked at the three men in the room with me: the sleeping survivor, the surrogate father, the brother-in-arms. This was my team. Not the names on a roster, not the assets on a spreadsheet. This. This broken, beautiful, fiercely loyal group of human beings.
The silence between us wasn’t awkward. It was a shared space of grief and understanding. We had been through a war together. There were no words necessary.
Finally, Cora pushed himself off the wall, his movements slow and stiff. He walked over to Casas and put a hand on his shoulder.
“You did good, kid,” Cora said, his voice a rough, gravelly whisper. “You showed up. That’s what matters.”
Casas looked up, his eyes full of a sad wisdom. “We all did, skip.”
Cora nodded, then looked at me. His eyes were red-rimmed but clear, full of a new, unbreakable bond forged in the crucible of the last hour. “Craig.”
It was all he said. It was all he needed to say.
I just nodded back. I know.
We were no longer just a manager and a GM. We were partners in a way that transcended our titles. We were the guardians of the men in that room. We were the keepers of a sacred, terrible trust. The game of baseball, with its wins and losses, seemed like a frivolous, distant thing. This was the real season. This was the only game that mattered.
<Casas was confused why Jarren kept mentioning the park, baseballs, get a hit, go back><Cora and Craig explained everything to him><add more details>
We stood in the quiet hum of the medical room, a silent triumvirate watching over the sleeping man in the bed. After a long while, Triston Casas broke the silence, his voice a low, confused rumble that seemed to absorb the stillness of the room.
“I don’t… I don’t get it,” he said, shaking his head slowly. He wasn’t looking at us, but at Jarren’s peaceful, exhausted face. “All that stuff he was saying… about the park. About getting a hit. ‘Go back to the park.’ What was that? It sounded like he was… a kid.”
He finally looked up, his eyes full of a genuine, searching confusion. “And the baseballs… he kept talking about baseballs. It didn’t make any sense.”
Cora and I exchanged a long, heavy look. It was a silent question: Do we tell him? The story was a sacred, private thing. But Casas hadn’t just been a bystander. He had been in the trenches with us. He had held Jarren down. He had offered his strength and his heart. He had earned the right to understand the battle he had just fought.
I gave Cora a slight, almost imperceptible nod. This was his clubhouse. His player. He should be the one to tell the story.
Cora let out a long, weary sigh and motioned for Casas to follow him. We moved to the far corner of the room, putting some distance between us and Jarren, our voices dropping to hushed, conspiratorial whispers.
“Triston,” Cora began, his voice low and heavy. “What you heard in here today… it doesn’t leave this room. Ever. What I’m about to tell you is about building trust. It’s about understanding why we have to protect that man in that bed with everything we have.”
Casas nodded, his expression serious, his full attention on his manager.
“Jarren… he had a tough childhood,” Cora said, the words an immense understatement. “His father… he loved him. He does love him. But he was hard on him. Unbelievably hard. He was a big man, and Jarren was a small kid. And his dad coached him.”
Cora paused, gathering himself. “He used to take him to a park for batting practice. And if Jarren wasn’t swinging right, if he wasn’t ‘being better,’ his dad… his dad would get angry. He would throw baseballs at him. To hit him.”
Casas’s face went slack with disbelief. The color drained from his cheeks. “He… what?”
“He pegged him with baseballs,” Cora confirmed, his voice flat, devoid of emotion. “And when Jarren would run home crying, his dad would just wait. Because he knew Jarren’s pride, his refusal to fail, would always make him come back. So ‘going back to the park’… it means going back to the pain. To the punishment. To prove he can take it.”
I stepped in, my own voice a low murmur. “So today, when the pain got to be too much, his mind couldn’t process it as medicine. It could only process it as punishment. He thought he was back in that park. He thought he was being punished for every mistake he’s ever made. For not being good enough. For not being big enough.”
Casas sank back into his chair, his mouth agape. He stared at Jarren’s sleeping form with a new, horrified understanding. The confusing, delirious ramblings now snapped into a terrifyingly clear focus.
“Oh my God,” he whispered, his voice cracking. “The inside-the-parker… the strikeouts… he was apologizing. He thought… he thought this was the price.”
“Yes,” Cora said softly. “He thought this was the price.”
Triston buried his face in his hands, his broad shoulders shaking. “And I… I was holding him down,” he choked out. “He was screaming for his dad, and I was holding him down.”
“You were holding him together,” I corrected him gently but firmly. “You, me, Alex… we were the ones who were there for him when he couldn’t be there for himself. We were the family he needed in that moment. Don’t you ever forget that.”
Casas looked up, his eyes wet with tears, but also filled with a new, fierce, protective fire. He looked at Jarren, no longer with confusion, but with a profound, heartbreaking empathy and a resolve that was as strong as steel.
“I get it now,” he whispered, his voice full of a solemn, terrible weight. “I get it.”
He understood. He understood the mission. He had been fully initiated into the circle of protectors. And the bond in that room, forged in the fires of a pain none of them would ever forget, became unbreakable.
<The fever broke the next day. >
<Jarren woke up, only had some vague pieces of the ordeal.>
<add more details>
The third day dawned not with a bang, but with a quiet, merciful peace.
Sometime in the pre-dawn hours, the fever broke. It didn’t crash; it simply receded, like a malevolent tide pulling away from the shore. The frantic rhythm of the heart monitor slowed to a steady, reassuring beat. The flush on Jarren’s cheeks faded, leaving him pale but no longer burning. His breathing deepened, losing its shallow, ragged edge. He was sleeping, truly sleeping, for the first time in what felt like an eternity.
The atmosphere in the room shifted from tense vigilance to a profound, bone-deep relief. The rotation of teammates continued, but their faces were no longer etched with worry. They were just watching over a friend who was finally on the mend.
I had gone back to my office to handle the mountain of work that had accumulated, but I returned in the late morning. Cora was there, sitting in the chair by the bed, a cup of coffee in his hand, looking exhausted but peaceful.
Around 11 a.m., Jarren stirred. It was a different kind of waking. Not the feverish twitching or the confused mumbling. It was a slow, natural return to consciousness.
His eyelids fluttered, then opened. He blinked a few times, his eyes adjusting to the soft light of the room. He looked around, his gaze slow, taking in the IV stand, the monitor, the chair where Cora sat. There was a deep, hazy confusion in his eyes, the look of a man trying to piece together a fragmented, terrible dream.
He lifted his right hand to rub his eyes, then noticed his left. He stared at the thick, white bandage for a long moment, a flicker of memory, of pain, crossing his face.
“Hey,” Cora said softly, his voice gentle. “Welcome back.”
Jarren turned his head on the pillow, his eyes finding his manager’s. “Alex?” he said, his voice a dry, unused croak. “What… what happened?”
He remembered the dive. He remembered the initial pain in the trainer’s room. But after that, it was a blur. A chaotic slideshow of disconnected images and emotions.
“You had a bad infection, mijo,” Cora explained simply. “A pretty high fever. The doctors had to go back in and clean out your hand again yesterday. You’ve been sleeping for a while.”
Jarren’s brow furrowed. He tried to sit up, a flicker of his old self returning, but a wave of profound weakness washed over him, and he sank back into the pillows.
“Yesterday?” he asked, his voice full of disbelief. “I… I don’t remember much.” He looked at Cora, a shadow of shame crossing his face. “Was I… was it bad?”
He had vague, nightmarish pieces. A feeling of being held down. A sense of overwhelming pain. The sound of screaming, maybe his own. He remembered a deep, primal fear, but the details were mercifully shrouded in the fog of the fever.
Cora smiled, a kind, reassuring smile that held no hint of the trauma they had all endured.
“You were a fighter,” he said, his voice full of a quiet pride. “You fought like hell. But it’s over now. You’re okay. The fever’s gone. You’re on the mend.”
He didn’t offer details. He didn’t mention the screaming, the thrashing, the heartbreaking confessions. He just gave him the one thing he needed to hear: reassurance. He was protecting the man not just from the infection, but from the memory of his own breakdown.
Jarren looked around the room again, at the chair where I sat, at the quiet hum of the machines. He seemed to sense the gravity of what had happened, even if he couldn’t recall it.
“You guys… you were here?” he asked, his voice small.
“We were here,” I said, my own voice steady. “The whole team. They’ve been taking shifts. Making sure you weren’t alone.”
He absorbed that, his eyes closing for a moment as he processed it. He had been at his weakest, his most vulnerable, and his team hadn’t mocked him or abandoned him. They had guarded him.
He opened his eyes and looked at Cora, a new, quiet understanding passing between them. He didn’t remember the details of the nightmare, but he remembered the feeling of being held, the sound of a comforting voice in the darkness.
“Thank you,” he whispered, the words simple, but carrying the weight of everything that had happened.
“Rest, mijo,” Cora said, patting his arm. “Just rest. We got everything else.”
And for the first time, without protest, without argument, he did. He closed his eyes and let himself drift back into a peaceful, healing sleep, secure in the knowledge that he was safe.
<Given the scare  yesterday, Doctors were very cautious when approaching Jarren><Jarren was confused><Casas, Craig, Cora made jokes about his fight with them, and with the doctors><add more details>
Later that afternoon, after another long stretch of peaceful sleep, Jarren was more lucid. The fog had lifted, leaving behind a landscape of exhaustion and confusion. The team doctor and a nurse came in to check his vitals and change the dressing on the IV line.
Their approach was a study in extreme caution. They spoke in low, soothing tones. They announced every move they were going to make. They moved slowly, deliberately, their hands always visible. It was the way one would approach a frightened, unpredictable animal.
Jarren watched them, his brow furrowed in bewilderment. “I’m not gonna bite, doc,” he said, his voice still weak but laced with a dry, confused humor.
The doctor just gave a tight, professional smile. “Just being thorough, Jarren.”
When they left, Jarren looked at me and Cora, who were back on duty. Triston Casas had just walked in, carrying a smoothie he’d had the clubhouse kitchen make.
“What’s with them?” Jarren asked, gesturing toward the door. “They’re acting like I’m gonna… I don’t know, explode or something.”
Cora, Casas, and I exchanged a look. It was a silent, instantaneous agreement. The truth of the trauma was too heavy for him to bear right now. But the truth of his strength? That was a story he needed to hear. And the only way to tell it was through the time-honored clubhouse tradition of relentless, affectionate mockery.
Cora leaned back in his chair, a slow, mischievous grin spreading across his face. “Explode? Mijo, you already did. Yesterday. You were like a superhero. A very angry, very loud superhero.”
Jarren stared at him, completely lost. “What are you talking about?”
“Oh, you don’t remember?” I said, feigning surprise. I picked up a water bottle from the table. “It was right after Dr. Alpert here made the mistake of trying to reason with you. You grabbed one of these and threw it so hard I think you broke the sound barrier. The doctor had to pull a move straight out of The Matrix to dodge it.”
Casas snorted, nearly spilling the smoothie. “Dude, it was epic. You went full-on beast mode. You threw me into the wall. Me! I’m twice your size! I think I have a bruise shaped like your hand on my arm.” He pulled up his sleeve, pretending to inspect his bicep with a look of mock horror.
Jarren’s jaw was hanging open. He looked from face to face, searching for a sign that we were kidding. He found none.
“No way,” he whispered, a look of dawning horror on his face. “I… I did that?”
“Did that?” Cora laughed, a full, genuine laugh this time. “Son, you had three of us—me, Craig, and a guy who could be a linebacker for the Patriots—playing defense, and you were still winning. We were about to call for backup. I was thinking about getting a riot shield.”
We were painting a picture not of a man breaking down, but of a warrior fighting off an army. We were reframing his terror as strength, his delirium as defiance. We were giving him a legend to believe in, instead of a trauma to be ashamed of.
“The best part,” I added, leaning forward conspiratorially, “was the roar. I don’t think I’ve heard a sound like that since I saw a nature documentary about grizzly bears. The nurses were ready to call Animal Control.”
Jarren buried his face in his good hand, groaning with a mixture of embarrassment and disbelief. “Oh my God. I am so, so sorry.”
“Sorry?” Cora said, his voice full of theatrical indignation. “Don’t be sorry! I’m putting you in the lineup as our emergency security guard. Nobody’s getting on the field with you around.” He winked at Casas. “We just have to make sure we keep the doctors and anyone in a white coat in the bleachers.”
Jarren looked up, a faint, hesitant smile finally touching his lips. He was still mortified, but he was starting to see the affection behind the teasing. He wasn’t being judged. He was being mythologized.
“So I was… a handful?” he asked, his voice small.
Casas took a sip of the smoothie. “Bro,” he said with a grin. “You were a legend. An absolute legend.”
In that moment, surrounded by the gentle, loving mockery of his teammates and mentors, the shame began to recede. We were giving him a different story to remember. Not the story of a man who broke, but the story of a man so tough, it took an entire army to hold him down. And in the quiet safety of that room, that was a story he could learn to live with.
<Doctors suggested Jarren get some food and drink><Jarren had no stomach for anything after two days of fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details>
After the laughter subsided, a nurse came in with a tray. On it was a bowl of chicken broth, some crackers, and a glass of ginger ale.
“Doctor’s orders,” she said with a warm, knowing smile that didn’t quite reach her cautious eyes. “We need to get some fluids and calories in you. Start slow.”
Jarren looked at the tray with a distinct lack of enthusiasm. The fever had scorched his appetite, leaving behind a metallic taste in his mouth and a queasy, hollow feeling in his stomach. The thought of eating felt like a monumental effort.
“I’m not… I’m not hungry,” he said, shaking his head slightly. “Maybe later.”
“You gotta eat, man,” Casas said, gesturing with the smoothie. “This stuff is pretty good. It’s got bananas.”
“Thanks, Tris,” Jarren said with a weak smile. “But I think I’ll pass.”
He lay back against the pillows, his eyes closing, ready to retreat back into sleep. But Cora wasn’t having it. The time for gentle coaxing was over. This was a different kind of battle now.
Cora stood up, took the bowl of broth from the tray, and picked up a spoon. He pulled his chair right up to the bedside.
“Sit up,” he said. It wasn’t a request.
Jarren’s eyes opened, a flicker of the old defiance returning. “Alex, I’m not…”
“I didn’t ask if you were hungry,” Cora said, his voice firm but his eyes soft. “I said, sit up. Your body needs fuel to fight. You think you can heal on nothing? You think you can get back on that field by starving yourself? That’s not how it works.”
He was speaking a language Jarren understood: the language of performance, of doing what’s necessary to get back in the game.
Reluctantly, Jarren pushed himself up, wincing as the movement pulled at his tired muscles. He sat slumped against the pillows, looking at the bowl with weary resignation.
“Good,” Cora said. He dipped the spoon into the broth and held it out. “Now, open up.”
Jarren stared at him, aghast. “You’re not going to feed me.”
“Watch me,” Cora said, his expression unyielding. “You’re too weak to do it yourself, and I’m not letting you use that as an excuse. We’re a team. Right now, my job is to make sure you get your fuel. Your job is to swallow. So, open.”
It was a standoff. A battle of wills between a stubborn player and an even more stubborn manager. Jarren’s pride, what was left of it, bristled at the indignity. But he looked into Cora’s eyes and saw no mockery, no pity. He saw the same fierce, paternal determination that had held him together when he was screaming. This was just another form of that same protection.
With a long, defeated sigh, Jarren relented. He opened his mouth.
Cora gently guided the spoon in. Jarren swallowed, the warm, salty broth a surprisingly comforting sensation in his empty stomach.
“Good,” Cora said. “Again.”
And so it went. For the next fifteen minutes, the manager of the Boston Red Sox sat by the bed and patiently, stubbornly, fed his star player, one spoonful at a time. Casas and I watched in a silence that was filled with respect.
It was a slow, arduous process. After a few spoonfuls, Jarren would shake his head, insisting he was full. Cora would just wait, his expression implacable, until Jarren gave in and took another. He made him eat half the bowl of broth and drink half the glass of ginger ale.
When he was finally done, Cora set the bowl down. “See?” he said. “Not so bad.”
Jarren didn’t answer. He just lay back, a little more color in his cheeks, a little more life in his eyes. He had been cared for, completely and totally, in a way that went beyond medicine, beyond strategy.
He had been fed. He had been nurtured. He had been loved. And in the quiet of that room, it was a more powerful medicine than anything in the IV drip.
<Jarren felt much better in the afternoon><He went to the dugout to watch the game.><Teammates joked to him><For the first time, he realized even if he could't contribute, his teammates loved him just the same><add more details>
By late afternoon, the combination of the antibiotics, the forced nutrition, and a long, peaceful sleep had worked a small miracle. The deep, bone-weary exhaustion had receded, and for the first time in three days, Jarren looked like himself again. The color was back in his face, the light was back in his eyes. He was still weak, still moving carefully, but he was present.
He was also going stir-crazy.
“I can’t just lie here anymore,” he announced, swinging his legs over the side of the bed. “I need to… I need to see the field. I need to watch the game.”
The doctor, after a thorough check, reluctantly agreed. “Alright. But you take it easy. You sit in the dugout. You do not get excited. You do not move faster than a slow walk. Am I clear?”
“Crystal,” Jarren said with a grin, the first genuine one I’d seen in days.
Getting him dressed was a team effort, a gentle, humorous dance around his IV pole and his bandaged hand. He put on a team hoodie and a pair of sweatpants, and with Casas on one side and Devers on the other, he made the slow journey from the medical room, down the tunnel, and into the dugout.
It was the bottom of the fifth inning. The dugout, usually a hive of nervous energy, went quiet for a moment as he entered. Then, the roasting began.
“Hey, look what the cat dragged in!” yelled Pivetta from the far end of the bench. “Thought we were gonna have to get you a permanent room here, JD.”
“Don’t let him near the water cooler!” Bregman shouted with a laugh. “He might try to throw it at somebody!”
Jarren’s face flushed with a familiar embarrassment, but this time, it was different. It was lighter. He smiled, shaking his head.
He found a spot on the bench between Cora and Devers. Raffy immediately threw an arm around his shoulder. “Feeling better, hermano?”
“Yeah, much better,” Jarren said, his voice still a little rough.
“Good,” Raffy said with a grin. “Because your replacement in left field has a noodle arm. We need you back.”
For the next four innings, Jarren just sat there, a part of the team again. He watched the game, he listened to the chatter, he felt the familiar rhythm of the dugout. And as he sat there, a profound, revolutionary thought began to take root in his mind.
He wasn’t playing. He wasn’t hitting home runs. He wasn’t making spectacular catches. He was contributing nothing to the game being played on the field. He was just… there.
And nobody cared.
They didn’t treat him differently. They didn’t look at him with pity or disappointment. They joked with him. They asked him what he saw in a pitcher’s delivery. They included him in the conversations, in the camaraderie, in the life of the team.
He watched as Roman Anthony, his temporary replacement, made a great running catch in the gap, and he found himself cheering, a genuine, unselfish burst of joy for his teammate’s success.
In that moment, sitting on the bench, unable to contribute anything but his presence, he felt a lifetime of conditioning begin to fall away. His value, he was starting to realize, was not solely dependent on his performance. His father’s love may have felt conditional, but this… this was not. This was something else.
He was loved not for what he did, but for who he was. He was their teammate. He was their brother. And whether he was hitting walk-off home runs or sitting on the bench with a bandaged hand and a fever, that fact did not change.
As the final out of the game was made, Devers slung an arm around his shoulder again. “Come on, legend,” he said with a grin. “Let’s go celebrate. You’ve earned it.”
Walking back into the clubhouse, surrounded by the easy, boisterous energy of a team after a win, Jarren felt a sense of belonging that was deeper and more real than any MVP chant or media praise. For the first time in his life, he understood. He didn’t have to earn his place here. He was already home.
<the first doctor who was brave enough stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. It almost gave the doctor a haricut.> <Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning> <It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done> <add more details> <stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
The specialist, a man accustomed to being in control, took a slow, deliberate step forward. His hands were still raised, his voice calm and placating. “Jarren, my name is Dr. Alpert. We are in the hospital at Fenway Park. You have an infection. We need to help you. No one is going to hurt you.”
He crossed an invisible line.
The reaction was faster than a 98-mph fastball. Jarren’s head snapped toward the doctor, his eyes locking on the perceived threat. His good hand, moving with a speed that was terrifyingly at odds with his sickness, shot out and grabbed a glass of water from the bedside table. In a single, fluid, violent motion, he hurled it.
The glass flew through the air, a missile of water and plastic, and shattered against the wall just inches from Dr. Alpert’s head. A shard of plastic nicked his ear, drawing a tiny bead of blood. He flinched back, his face pale with shock, the professional calm finally broken.
The standoff was over. This was now a siege.
“Nobody moves,” I said, my voice a low, hard command. The medical staff, who had been inching forward, froze in place.
Jarren stood panting against the wall, his chest heaving, his wild eyes scanning the room for the next threat. Any time a nurse or doctor shifted their weight or took a step, a low, guttural roar would erupt from his chest, a clear, primal warning to stay back. He was guarding his territory, his body a fortress of fever and fear.
Dr. Alpert, clutching a piece of gauze to his bleeding ear, retreated to my side. His face was grim.
“This is untenable,” he whispered, his voice shaky. “We can’t get near him. He’s a danger to himself and to us. The local anesthetic plan is out. We have to sedate him.”
“You said it was too risky,” I shot back, my own heart hammering.
“It’s riskier not to,” he countered, his voice regaining its clinical edge. “The infection is a clear and present danger. Sepsis will kill him. A controlled, monitored sedation is now the lesser of two evils. We have no other choice.”
He turned to one of the nurses. “Get me five milligrams of midazolam in a syringe. And get the intubation kit ready as a precaution.”
The nurse, her own face pale, hurried to comply.
The word ‘sedation’ hung in the air, a heavy, final admission of defeat. We were going to have to chemically subdue him, to render him completely unconscious, just to provide the care he desperately needed. It felt like a profound violation.
But as I looked at Jarren, crouched against the wall like a cornered wolf, I knew the doctor was right. We couldn’t reach the man inside. We had to get past the animal first.
The nurse returned with the syringe. The clear liquid inside it seemed like a terrible, necessary poison.
Now came the impossible part. Someone had to get close enough to administer it.
Dr. Alpert looked at the syringe, then at Jarren, then at the circle of terrified medical staff. He was a man of science, not a lion tamer.
Before anyone could speak, before a plan could be formed, Alex Cora took a slow, deep breath. He looked at me, his eyes full of a grim resolve. Then, he took a single, deliberate step forward, crossing the invisible line.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked at the mention of going back to that hell> <add more details>
The moment Schneider uncapped the bottle of Betadine, the smell cut through the room—sharp, chemical, and brutally familiar. It was the scent of the inferno.
For Jarren’s fevered mind, it was more powerful than any word, more terrifying than any blade. It was the smell of the worst moment of his life, a sensory trigger that bypassed all reason and plunged him straight back into the heart of the trauma.
His head snapped up from Cora’s shoulder. The brief moment of lucidity, of fighting with us, vanished. His eyes, which had been starting to clear, clouded over again with a new, more profound terror. It wasn’t the mindless rage of the fever this time. It was the lucid, absolute horror of a man who knows exactly what is coming.
“No,” he gasped, the word a desperate, pleading whisper. He started to struggle again, but his movements were weaker now, born of sheer panic rather than adrenaline. “No, not again. Please, Alex. No.”
He looked at Cora, his eyes begging for mercy, for a reprieve he knew wasn’t coming. “You said… you said you wouldn’t let them hurt me.”
The words were a knife in Cora’s heart. He flinched, his face a mask of anguish. “Mijo, this isn’t hurting you. This is saving you. This is the last step. I promise. This is the end of it.”
“I can’t,” Jarren sobbed, shaking his head frantically, his body trembling with a new wave of fear. “I can’t go back there. It’s… it’s too much. Please.”
He was pleading for his life, for his sanity. He was a man being asked to willingly walk back into the torture chamber.
I saw the hesitation in Schneider’s eyes. He looked at the doctor, a silent question passing between them. Could they skip this? Was there another way?
The specialist stepped forward, his voice firm but compassionate. “Jarren, listen to me. This is not a choice. The infection in your hand is aggressive. If we don’t sterilize this wound completely, right now, you could lose more than just the season. You could lose function in your hand. This is the only way. It will be over in thirty seconds.”
Thirty seconds. An eternity.
Jarren looked at me, his eyes wide with a child’s desperate, final appeal. “Craig… please.”
I met his gaze, my own heart shattering. I had to be the anchor. I had to be the voice of unavoidable truth.
“He’s right, Jarren,” I said, my voice heavy, absolute. “There is no other way. We have to do this. But we will do it together. All of us. We will hold on. We will not let you go.”
I looked at Cora, at Casas. They nodded, their faces grim, resolute. We retook our positions, our grips firm, bracing for the final, terrible storm.
Schneider took a deep breath and soaked a large pad of gauze with the dark, viscous Betadine. It looked like liquid rust. Liquid pain.
“I’m sorry, Jarren,” Schneider whispered, his voice thick with regret.
He leaned in to begin.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <add more details>

The moment Schneider uncapped the bottle of Betadine, the smell cut through the room—sharp, chemical, and brutally clean. It was a scent that promised both salvation and damnation.
For Jarren, it was the latter.
The smell sliced through the last vestiges of his feverish delirium like a surgeon’s blade, yanking him back to a state of horrifying, lucid terror. His wild, unfocused eyes snapped into sharp, terrified clarity. He knew that smell. He knew what it meant.
The fight returned, but it was different now. It wasn’t the mindless rage of a cornered animal. It was the desperate, intelligent panic of a man who knew exactly what was about to happen to him and was willing to do anything to stop it.
“No,” he gasped, his voice a raw, pleading whisper. He looked at Cora, his eyes begging. “Alex, please. No. You promised. You promised you wouldn’t let them hurt me.”
He twisted in our grip, his movements no longer just convulsive, but calculated. He was trying to find leverage, to break our hold.
“Mijo, this is the last thing,” Cora said, his own voice strained, his heart breaking all over again. “This is the one that saves you. We have to.”
Jarren’s eyes darted to Casas. “Triston,” he pleaded, his voice cracking. “Man, please. Don’t let him. I can’t. I can’t do it again. It’s too much.”
Casas’s face was a mask of pure misery. He just shook his head, his jaw tight, unable to form words. He held on, his grip like a vise, his loyalty at war with his empathy.
Finally, Jarren’s terrified gaze landed on me. It was the desperate, last-ditch appeal of a condemned man to the final authority.
“Craig,” he choked out, tears streaming down his face now. “Please. I’m begging you. Make him stop. I’ll do anything. I’ll sit out the rest of the year. I don’t care. Just… just don’t let him do that to me again. Please.”
His plea was a physical blow. He was offering up his career, the thing he had sacrificed everything for, in exchange for a reprieve from this one, final, unbearable torment.
I looked at Schneider, who stood waiting, the soaked gauze in his hand, his own face a grim portrait of necessity. I looked at Cora and Casas, their faces etched with the agony of their task.
There was no choice. There was only the grim, terrible path forward.
I leaned in close, my face just inches from his, my voice low and full of a pain that mirrored his own.
“I am so sorry, Jarren,” I whispered, the words feeling like shards of glass in my throat. “I am so, so sorry. But we have to do this. This is the one that saves your life.”
I gave Schneider a single, sharp nod.
“Hold him,” I said to the other two, my voice a hard, cracked command.
And as Schneider leaned in with the liquid fire, I prepared myself for the screams.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <They coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts> <add more details>
Schneider uncapped the bottle of Betadine.
The scent that filled the room was sharp, acrid, and brutally chemical. It was the smell of pure, unadulterated antiseptic, a smell that promised both cleanliness and a world of pain.
That smell, more than any word or touch, cut through the last vestiges of Jarren’s feverish delirium. His wild, unfocused eyes suddenly snapped into a terrifyingly lucid clarity. He knew that smell. He remembered it.
And he panicked.
“No,” he whispered, the word a dry, terrified croak. He looked at Cora, his eyes wide with a desperate, pleading horror. “Alex, no. Please. Not again. I can’t.”
He turned his gaze to Casas, who still had a firm grip on his legs. “Triston, man, please. Tell them no. You saw what it did. Please.”
Finally, his eyes found mine. They were the eyes of a man begging for his life. “Craig,” he pleaded, his voice cracking. “You promised. You said it was to protect me. This isn’t… this is just… pain. Please. Make them stop.”
The raw, desperate sincerity of his pleas was a physical blow. He wasn’t fighting us anymore. He was begging his family to save him from a torment he knew he could not endure again.
Cora’s face was a mask of profound, paternal agony. He hated this. He hated every second of it. But he knew it was necessary.
“Mijo,” he said, his voice thick with an emotion he was struggling to control. “I know. I know. But this is the last step. This is the one that kills the infection. This is the one that lets you heal. We have to do this. It’s the only way.”
“It’s gonna be bad, JD,” Casas said, his own voice rough. “We’re not gonna lie to you. But we’re not leaving. We’re gonna be right here, the whole time. We’ll hold on. You just have to hold on with us.”
I knelt down again, putting myself directly in his line of sight, forcing him to see the resolve in my eyes.
“Jarren,” I said, my voice low and steady, a bedrock of absolute certainty in the swirling chaos of his fear. “This is the last battle. This is the one we win. It’s going to be long. It’s going to be hell. But on the other side of this is health. On the other side of this is you, whole again. We are going to walk through this fire with you, every single step of the way.”
I looked at Schneider. “How long?”
“I can’t just pour it on,” Schneider said, his voice grim. “The wound is too deep, too inflamed. I have to soak the gauze and hold it there. I have to keep it saturated. Five minutes. Maybe more. It has to stay on to work.”
Five minutes. An eternity.
I turned back to Jarren. “You heard him,” I said. “It’s going to be a long five minutes. But we are stronger than the pain. All of us, together. You, me, Alex, Triston. We are stronger. You have to believe that.”
I looked at Cora. He took Jarren’s good hand again. “Apriétame la mano, campeón.”
I looked at Casas. He adjusted his grip on Jarren’s legs, a silent promise of unwavering support.
Jarren looked at the three of us, his chest heaving with ragged, terrified breaths. He was being asked to willingly submit to a prolonged, agonizing procedure that had broken him once already. There was no fight left in him. There was only a vast, empty ocean of fear.
He closed his eyes, a single tear tracing a path down his temple. He gave a small, almost imperceptible nod of surrender.
Schneider took a deep breath, his own face pale. He soaked a large pad of gauze in the dark, viscous Betadine.
“Okay,” he said, his voice a grim whisper. “Going on now.”
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left> <He was hurled back to the park> <He thought this was the punishment for his failures> <He apologized for everything he could remember, sometimes his voice blurred > <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun: lost the ball in twilight. didn't chase after it because he was drained by helplessness and loneliness. Afraid to turn his head to look at the fans> <dropped two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that> <dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again(even though everyone else in the room thought it wasn't a good idea to smother a liner off Corey Seager's bat, exit velo 110+)> <struck out with the bases loaded> <caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> <add more details> <the antiseptic is long from finished>
Schneider pressed the Betadine gauze to the wound.
There was no scream this time. There was no strength left for it.
The sound that escaped Jarren’s lips was a long, low, guttural moan of pure, hopeless agony. It was the sound of a soul surrendering. His body went rigid, a single, taut line of suffering, and then he simply… broke. The fight was gone. The thrashing was gone. All that remained was a deep, uncontrollable trembling and a torrent of whispered, delirious confessions.
He was hurled back to the park. The sterile room, the concerned faces, the modern medicine—it all dissolved into a sun-drenched field and the terrifying shadow of his father. This was his punishment. The pain was his penance.
“S-sorry…” he mumbled, his voice a slurred, broken whisper against Cora’s shirt. “Didn’t… didn’t swing my best… sorry…”
His body convulsed as Schneider methodically, relentlessly, worked the antiseptic into every raw crevice. The pain was a constant, searing wave, and with each crest, another memory of failure washed up from the depths of his subconscious.
“Not… not growing…” he choked out, tears mixing with the sweat on his face. “So sorry… not big enough…”
He was confessing to the crime of his own genetics, apologizing for a body he believed had failed his father from the start.
His mind jumped forward in time, to a different kind of failure. “Tapia…” he whispered, the name a ghost. “The twilight… I lost it… I just… stopped.” His breathing hitched, a sob catching in his throat. “Couldn’t… couldn’t look at them… the fans… so alone… I’m sorry… I didn’t run…” He was admitting not just to the physical error, but to the emotional surrender, the moment the loneliness had become too heavy to bear.
Another jolt of pain as Schneider found a new spot. “Kansas City…” he gasped. “Two… dropped two… then yelled… I’m sorry… so angry… sorry…”
He was confessing to the moments his composure had cracked, the times the pressure had become too much and the anger had spilled out.
His memories were a jumbled, non-linear litany of his greatest sins against himself. “Seager… the liner…” he mumbled, his body twitching. “Tried to… tried to smother it… get my body in front… but it was too fast… so fast…” Even in his delirium, he was apologizing for an act of insane bravery that everyone else in the room remembered with awe, recasting it as another failure.
“Bases loaded… I K’d… let everyone down…”
“Raffy was up… I got caught… shouldn’t have gone… sorry, Raffy… sorry…”
On and on it went. A heartbreaking, stream-of-consciousness confession. He was apologizing for every dropped ball, every strikeout, every mistake, every moment he had been anything less than perfect. He was a man on a rack, confessing his sins to his inquisitors, believing that this agony was the price he had to pay.
Cora held him, his own face a mask of silent, stoic anguish, his eyes squeezed shut as if he could block out the terrible, whispered words. Casas had his head bowed, his hand a steady, unmoving weight on Jarren’s leg. I stood my ground, a silent, helpless witness, my heart breaking with every new apology.
Schneider worked on, his movements relentless, his face a grim, unreadable mask. The antiseptic process was long, meticulous, and far from over. And with every passing second, Jarren Duran drifted further away, lost in the park, paying a price for a debt that had never existed.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left> <He was hurled back to the park> <He thought this was the punishment for his failures> <He apologized for everything he could remember, sometimes his voice blurred > <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun: lost the ball in twilight. didn't chase after it because he was drained by helplessness and loneliness. Afraid to turn his head to look at the fans> <dropped two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that><dropped an easy liner, cost the game, Bello was furious, Bello shouted "Incredible! You must be fucking kidding me"> <dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again(even though everyone else in the room thought it wasn't a good idea to smother a liner off Corey Seager's bat, exit velo 110+)> <struck out with the bases loaded> <caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> <add more details> <the antiseptic is long from finished>
The moment the Betadine made contact, there was no scream. The capacity for that kind of explosive reaction was gone. All the fight had been burned out of him.
What came instead was a low, guttural, continuous moan, a sound of pure, unending agony that seemed to emanate from the very center of the earth. His body went rigid, a single, long, unbroken tremor of torment. He didn’t thrash. He didn’t fight. He just endured, his eyes squeezed shut, tears leaking from the corners and tracing paths through the sweat and grime on his face.
He was hurled back to the park. And this time, he didn’t fight his father. He accepted the punishment.
His mind, shattered by pain and fever, began to confess. It was a torrent of whispered, broken apologies, a litany of every failure, every mistake, every moment of perceived weakness that had ever haunted him.
“S-sorry…” he mumbled into Cora’s shirt, his voice a slurred, barely audible whisper. “Didn’t… didn’t swing my best… sorry, Dad…”
Schneider continued his slow, meticulous work, painting the raw flesh with liquid fire. With every agonizing second that passed, another ghost was summoned from Jarren’s memory.
“Not… not growing…” he choked out, a fresh wave of pain causing his body to arch. “So sorry… not big enough…”
He was a boy again, apologizing for his own body.
“The ball…” he gasped, his mind jumping years ahead to a specific, scarring moment at Fenway. “Tapia… lost it… in the twilight…” His breathing hitched. “Didn’t… didn’t chase it… I was so… so tired… so alone…” His voice broke. “Afraid… afraid to look at the fans… knew they hated me… I’m sorry… I let you down…”
He was confessing not just the physical error, but the emotional failure behind it. The helplessness. The loneliness.
“Kansas City…” he whispered, the name of the city a curse. “Two… dropped two… shouldn’t have… then the fan… I’m sorry… so sorry…”
Schneider moved to a new section of the wound, and a fresh jolt of agony shot through him.
“Bello…” he cried out, the name a shard of glass in his throat. “The liner… it was so easy… should have had it… He was so mad… He yelled… ‘fucking kidding me’… He was right… he was right… I’m sorry, Brayan…”
He was apologizing to his teammates, convinced he had failed them, that he deserved their anger.
“Seager…” he mumbled, his mind now a blur of painful images. “The dive… missed it… tried to smother it… I know… I know it was stupid… exit velo… so fast… just… just wanted to make the play… wanted to be better… sorry…”
Even in his delirium, he was critiquing his own decisions, flagellating himself for trying too hard.
“Bases loaded… struck out…”
“Caught stealing… Raffy was up… should have scored…”
On and on it went. A stream-of-consciousness confession of every sin, real or imagined. He was a man convinced that this agony was his penance, a righteous punishment for a lifetime of not being good enough.
Cora held him, his own face a mask of silent, empathetic torment, absorbing every whispered confession like a priest in a war zone. Casas and I were frozen, silent witnesses to a self-immolation. We were holding him steady as he burned, our faces etched with a shared, helpless horror.
Schneider, his own eyes grim and focused behind his mask, continued his terrible, necessary work. The antiseptic process was long, meticulous, and far, far from over. And with every passing second, another layer of Jarren Duran’s soul was laid bare.
<the promises became more frentic, as the fire burnt harder> <I’ll hit a leadoff homer. > <I’ll pull on a straight steal of home> <He make promises on hitting that even Judge will hesitate to make.> <He make promises on defense that even JBJ will refuse to make> <He make promises on base stealing even Trea Turner will fail to accomplish> <He swear he would do anything.

The end was in sight. Schneider was on the final quadrant of the wound, the last patch of un-sanitized flesh. But for Jarren, lost in the inferno, this final stretch was the hottest. His promises, already impossible, escalated into a frantic, feverish auction of his own future, each bid more desperate than the last.
“Leadoff homer,” he gasped, his body arching as Schneider’s gauze found a particularly raw nerve. “Tomorrow. I’ll hit a leadoff homer. First pitch. I swear.”
He was trying to bargain with the pain, offering up heroic feats as tribute.
“Steal home,” he choked out, his voice cracking. “Straight steal. I’ll do it. Next time I’m on third. I’ll do it. You’ll see.”
Cora just held him tighter, his own face a mask of anguish, whispering, “Ya casi, mijo, ya casi…” Almost there, son, almost there…
The promises became mythical, the stuff of legend, the desperate boasts of a man willing to say anything to make the torment stop.
“I’ll hit .400,” he cried, the words tumbling out in a rush. “Fifty homers. I’ll lead the league. I’ll be better than Judge. Better than Ohtani. I swear… I swear…”
Schneider made a slow, deliberate pass along the outer edge of his palm. Jarren let out a high, thin wail.
“I’ll rob every home run,” he sobbed. “Nothing gets by me. Nothing. I’ll make plays JBJ never even dreamed of. I’ll be the best ever. Just… please…”
His promises on the basepaths were just as wild. “I’ll steal a hundred bases,” he pleaded, his voice hoarse. “Never get caught. Not once. Faster than Turner. Faster than anyone. Please… please make it stop…”
The promises dissolved into a final, desperate, all-encompassing plea. He was out of specifics. He had nothing left to offer but his own soul.
“Anything,” he wept, the word a raw, open wound of its own. He was no longer looking at ghosts; his delirious, tear-filled eyes found mine. “Anything you ask. I’ll do it. I’ll be good. I’ll be perfect. Just… please… let it stop. Please…”
It was the cry of the boy in the park, finally broken. The ultimate surrender.
And then, it was over.
Schneider lifted the gauze for the last time. He set the Betadine bottle down on the tray with a soft, final thud.
The fire was out.
He quickly, gently, applied the thick, cooling layer of ointment. A long, shuddering sigh escaped Jarren’s lips, the first breath he had taken that wasn’t a gasp of pain.
The room was silent, save for the sound of Jarren’s ragged, exhausted breathing. The promises, the pleas, the ghosts—they all hung in the air for a moment, then slowly, mercifully, began to fade.
<Doctors were expecting a weak patient, not a trapped animal with the strength of world class athletic> <Their first attempt only served to wake up the wild animal> <Jarren’s eyes opened, but they were wild, with no consciousness. He was fighting the demons.> <Jarren threw Casas, Craig and Cora off, they backed up into a circle> <add more details> <stop the scene here. Before the second attempt was made.>
The first snip of the scissors through the outer layer of gauze was the spark.
The reaction was instantaneous and terrifyingly violent.
It wasn’t a conscious act. It was a primal, neurological explosion. The fever, the infection, the subconscious memory of the previous trauma—it all converged in a single, explosive moment.
Jarren’s body didn’t just flinch; it erupted.
A raw, guttural roar of pure, mindless rage ripped from his throat. His eyes flew open, but there was no one home. They were wide, wild, and completely disconnected from the room, seeing only the phantoms of his fever dream. He was a cornered animal, and the touch of the scissors was the closing of the trap.
He launched himself upright with a surge of adrenaline-fueled power that was horrifying to behold. The IV pole crashed to the ground. The heart monitor screamed its alarm as leads were ripped from his chest. He wasn’t a weak, sick patient. He was a world-class athlete, a coiled spring of explosive muscle, and his body was reacting with every ounce of its trained power.
Cora, who had been holding his shoulder, was thrown backward as if by a lineman’s shove, stumbling into the wall. Casas, trying to hold his arm steady, was flung aside, his size and strength meaningless against the sheer, convulsive force. I, attempting to hold his other side, was knocked off balance, catching myself on the edge of the bed before I fell.
He was on his feet, unsteady but upright, in the center of the room. He was a caged tiger, his head swiveling, his body tensed, his breathing a series of harsh, ragged snarls. He wasn’t seeing doctors or teammates. He was seeing threats. He was seeing ghosts.
“Get back!” he screamed, his voice a raw, unrecognizable rasp. He raised his bandaged hand, not in pain, but as if it were a club, a weapon. “Don’t touch me!”
The medical team froze, their faces a mixture of shock and fear. The specialist held up his hands in a universal gesture of peace. “Jarren, it’s okay. We’re trying to help you.”
But the words didn’t penetrate the fever. He backed away, stumbling, until his back hit the wall. He crouched slightly, his eyes darting between all of us, a low growl rumbling in his chest. He was ready to fight. He was ready to defend himself from the demons that were suddenly wearing the faces of his friends.
The four of us—me, Cora, Casas, and the specialist—slowly, instinctively, formed a loose, cautious circle around him. We were no longer a shield. We were tamers in a cage with a wild animal that had been pushed too far.
“Jarren,” Cora said, his voice low and steady, trying to find the man inside the fever. “Mijo. It’s me. It’s Alex. You’re safe.”
Jarren’s wild eyes flickered toward the sound of his voice, but there was no recognition. Only a deeper growl.
The room was a standoff. A sick, terrified, and immensely powerful man, trapped in a nightmare, holding his would-be saviors at bay. The antiseptic hadn’t even been opened yet. The first attempt hadn’t just failed; it had woken the beast.
<the first doctor who was brave enough stepped across the invisible line. Jarren’s hand grabbed a glass with uncanny speed and hurled it at him. The aim was true. The doctor dodged on pure instinct and landed on his backside. It almost gave the doctor a haricut.> <Any medical staff who came near the line would be met with a roar of warning> <It became clear they had to sedate Jarren to get the process done> <add more details> <stop the scene here, before Cora stepped up to calm Jarren down>
The standoff held for a long, tense minute, the only sounds the frantic, unanswered alarm of the heart monitor and Jarren’s harsh, ragged breathing. We were frozen, a circle of helplessness around a raging fire.
The infectious disease specialist, a man accustomed to being in control, made a decision. He took a slow, deliberate step forward, his hands still raised in a placating gesture. “Jarren,” he said, his voice calm and authoritative, trying to project a sense of medical command. “My name is Dr. Alpert. I need you to lie back down. We have to treat your hand.”
He crossed an invisible line.
Jarren’s reaction was faster than any play he had ever made on a baseball field. It was pure, instinctual, reptilian speed. His eyes locked onto the doctor, and his good hand shot out, grabbing a heavy glass water pitcher from the bedside table that had somehow remained upright.
With a guttural roar, he hurled it.
It wasn’t a wild, panicked throw. It was a pitcher’s throw. It was aimed. The glass missile flew through the air with terrifying velocity, aimed directly at the doctor’s head.
Dr. Alpert had no time to think. He reacted on pure, animal instinct, dropping and twisting away. The pitcher shattered against the wall exactly where his head had been a split second before, exploding in a shower of glass and water. The sound was like a gunshot in the small room. The doctor landed hard on his backside, his face ashen, staring at the web of cracks in the wall plaster. A few inches higher, and it wouldn’t have been a haircut.
The violence of the act shocked the room into a new, more terrifying reality. This wasn’t just a delirious patient. This was a dangerous situation.
One of the nurses, seeing the doctor fall, let out a small scream and took a step forward to help him.
“STAY BACK!” Jarren bellowed, his voice a raw, primal command. He was crouched lower now, his eyes burning with a feverish intensity, scanning the room for the next threat. Any time a nurse or doctor shifted their weight or moved even a fraction of an inch closer, he would let out a low, warning roar, like a cornered wolf.
The medical team was effectively pinned against the walls, unable to approach, unable to treat.
The specialist, scrambling back to his feet, looked at me, his professional calm completely gone, replaced by a stark, pragmatic fear.
“That’s it,” he said, his voice shaky but firm. “I can’t… we can’t do it like this. He’s going to hurt himself or someone else. The risk of sedation is now lower than the risk of continuing this way. We have to put him under.”
He turned to one of the nurses. “Get me five milligrams of midazolam in a syringe. Now.”
The nurse, her own face pale, nodded and scurried toward the crash cart, keeping a wide, fearful berth around Jarren.
But the problem remained. To administer the sedative, someone had to get close enough to inject it. Someone had to get past the wild animal who had just tried to take a doctor’s head off with a water pitcher.
We were at an impasse. A complete and total breakdown. The medical solution was clear, but its implementation was impossible. We were trapped, held hostage by the very man we were trying to save.
<Cora realized it was the white uniform and scent of antiseptic on the medical staff that scared Jarren. That’s why the line for doctors was further than the line for him, Casas and Craig> <He saw the helplessness beneath the rage. > <Cora stepped up with open hands, showing he had nothing to hurt Jarren> <Jarren seemed to regard Cora as less of a threat. Reluctantly let Cora came near.> <Cora talked Jarren into going back to the bed, holding him like his own son><Craig and Casas held Jarren's arms and legs> <the medical staff tried to do this without sedative> <add more details> <stop the scene before their second attempt>
In the tense, glass-strewn silence, Alex Cora’s eyes, sharp and observant even in the chaos, noticed something. Jarren’s wild, scanning gaze was different depending on who it landed on. When it swept over me or Casas, it was wary, defensive. But when it landed on the blue scrubs and white coats of the medical staff, it was filled with a primal, unadulterated terror. The invisible line he had drawn was not a perfect circle. It was closer for us, further for them.
Cora understood. It wasn’t us he was afraid of. It was them. It was the white coats, the sharp, chemical smell of the antiseptic, the glint of steel—the sensory triggers of the trauma he had just endured. He wasn’t fighting his friends; he was fighting his torturers.
Beneath the rage, beneath the terrifying strength, Cora saw what no one else did: the small, terrified boy, convinced that the people in white were there to hurt him again.
A new calm settled over Cora’s face. He knew what he had to do.
He took a slow, deliberate step forward, into the no-man’s-land. He kept his hands open, palms forward, showing they were empty. He was unarmed. He was not a threat.
“Mijo,” he said, his voice a low, soothing murmur, the same tone he had used the night before. “It’s just me. It’s Alex. No one is going to hurt you.”
Jarren’s head snapped toward him, a low growl rumbling in his chest. But it was different. It was less aggressive, more of a warning. He was still a cornered animal, but he seemed to recognize that this was a member of his own pack, not a predator.
“I’m not going to touch you,” Cora continued, taking another slow, shuffling step. “I’m just going to stand here. Right here. See? Nothing in my hands.”
He stopped, a few feet away, just outside of arm’s reach. He didn’t try to get closer. He just stood there, a beacon of calm in the storm. He talked. He told stories. He talked about his own kids, about a funny thing that happened on the team plane, about the game yesterday. His voice was a steady, rhythmic drone, a hypnotic hum designed to soothe, to de-escalate, to find the man inside the fever.
Slowly, miraculously, it began to work.
The tension in Jarren’s shoulders lessened, just a fraction. The growl subsided. His breathing, still harsh, lost some of its ragged edge. He was still wary, still coiled, but he was listening.
After what felt like an eternity, Cora took another small step. Jarren flinched, but he didn’t roar. He just watched, his wild eyes filled with a dawning, confused recognition.
“We have to go back to the bed, Jarren,” Cora said softly. “You’re sick. We have to help you. I’m not going to let them hurt you. I promise. I’ll be right here. I won’t leave.”
He extended a hand, palm up. An offering. An invitation.
Jarren stared at the hand for a long, silent moment. Then, with a shuddering breath that seemed to drain the last of the fight out of him, he took a stumbling step forward and collapsed into Cora’s arms, just as he had done before.
“Okay,” Cora whispered, holding him tight. “Okay, mijo. I got you.”
He guided the now-limp and exhausted Jarren back to the bed. This was our chance.
“Now,” Cora said, his voice a sharp command to the rest of us.
Casas and I moved in. There was no gentleness this time. It was a grim, necessary task. Casas took hold of Jarren’s legs, using his own massive frame to pin them to the bed. I took his arms, holding them steady. Jarren, exhausted and confused, offered only a weak, token resistance.
Cora held his head, his face close to Jarren’s, his voice a constant stream of soothing Spanish. He was a living shield, blocking Jarren’s view of what was about to happen, trying to keep him anchored in the present.
The specialist, seeing the window of opportunity, looked at me, his eyes asking a silent question. He held the syringe of midazolam.
I looked at Jarren, held fast by the three of us. I thought of the risks. Then I thought of the trauma of the first attempt.
“No sedative,” I said, my voice a low, hard command. “Not unless you absolutely have to. Let’s try again. Fast. Get it done.”
The doctor nodded, a look of grim respect on his face. He handed the syringe to a nurse and picked up his own tools. The medical team, seeing our resolve, moved in quickly, a silent, coordinated unit.
We had him contained. The second attempt was about to begin. And we were all praying it would be the last.
<the debridement was worse this time, because of the wound is already inflamed and swollen> <some debris hide deep beneath the muscle fibers.> <Getting those debris out almost unleashed the wild animal again.><Cora and Craig managed to calm Jarren down> <add more details> <stop before the antiseptic>
The second attempt was a descent into a deeper, more brutal circle of hell. The wound, which had been a raw, open plain, was now an inflamed, swollen, and exquisitely tender landscape of infection. The tissue was angrier, the nerve endings screaming with a new intensity.
Schneider, his face grim, bypassed the forceps and went straight to the scalpel. “The inflammation is hiding things,” he muttered, more to himself than to us. “I have to get underneath it.”
The first touch of the blade was like a lightning strike.
Jarren’s body arched against our restraints with a force that was almost impossible to hold. A raw, strangled scream, muffled by Cora’s shoulder, tore through the room. His legs kicked wildly, and Casas had to use his entire body weight to keep them pinned. I felt Jarren’s arms strain against my grip, the muscles like iron bands, threatening to snap.
“Hold on, mijo! Hold on!” Cora’s voice was a desperate chant, his face pressed against Jarren’s temple. “We’re right here! Don’t go! Stay with me!”
Schneider worked with a desperate, focused speed. He scraped. He cut. He probed. It was a gruesome, bloody business. He pulled out a tiny, dark speck of debris, then another. But the fever-fueled infection had allowed the particles to burrow deeper.
“I’ve got one… it’s deep,” Schneider said, his voice tight with concentration. “It’s under the muscle fascia. I have to separate the fibers to get it.”
He adjusted his grip on the scalpel. This was no longer a surface procedure. This was an invasive, surgical act.
As he made the deeper incision, the wild animal was almost unleashed again.
Jarren’s eyes, which had been squeezed shut, flew open. They were wild, vacant, lost in the fever once more. A low, guttural roar started to build in his chest. He began to thrash with renewed, terrifying strength, his body fighting not just the pain, but the violation.
“No!” I shouted, my voice a sharp, cracking command. I leaned my weight onto his shoulders, trying to anchor him. “Jarren! Stay here! Stay with us! Don’t let it take you!”
Cora, seeing him slipping away, changed his tactic. He grabbed Jarren’s head with both hands, forcing him to look at him. “Jarren! Mírame! It’s me, Alex! This is not the park! This is not your father! This is us! We are helping you! You have to fight the fever, not us! Fight with us!”
The words, a desperate, brilliant gamble, seemed to find a crack in the delirium. The roaring subsided into a series of choked, agonized sobs. The thrashing lessened, replaced by a violent, full-body trembling. He was still in agony, but he was back in the room. He was fighting the right battle.
Schneider, seizing the moment, made his final, deepest move. He got the last piece of debris out.
“I’ve got it,” he breathed, his voice trembling with relief and exhaustion. “It’s clean. For real this time. It’s clean.”
He pulled back, his work with the blade finally, mercifully, done.
The three of us held on, our own bodies aching with the strain, our clothes soaked with a mixture of our sweat and his. We had held the line. We had gotten him through the worst of it.
But we all knew what was coming next.
Schneider reached for the ominous, dark brown bottle of Betadine. The final trial by fire.
<the smell of antiseptic cut through Jarren's delirious fog> <Jarren panicked. He pleaded with Cora, Craig and Casas> <Cora coaxed Jarren into accepting the antiseptic> <they know it's going to be a long process> <stop the scene before antiseptic starts> <add more details>
Schneider uncapped the bottle of Betadine.
The scent that filled the room was different from the iodine before. It was sharper, more potent, a purely chemical smell that cut through the thick, feverish air like a knife.
It cut through Jarren’s delirium.
His head snapped up from Cora’s shoulder. His wild, unfocused eyes suddenly gained a sliver of terrible clarity. He saw the dark brown liquid. He smelled the chemical fire. And he remembered.
The panic that flooded his face was a thousand times worse than before. It was not the mindless terror of a fever dream. It was the lucid, conscious terror of a man who knew exactly what was about to happen to him.
“No,” he whispered, the word a dry, desperate croak. He began to struggle again, but it wasn’t the violent thrashing of before. It was a weak, desperate, pleading struggle. “No, Alex, please. No. I can’t.”
He turned his terrified gaze to me. “Craig… please. You said… you said it was over.”
Then his eyes found Casas. “Triston… man, don’t let them. Please don’t let them do it.”
He was appealing to us, to the bonds we had forged, using our names, begging us to save him from the very people who were trying to do just that. It was a heartbreaking, impossible plea.
Cora held him tight, his own face a mask of profound, empathetic pain. “Mijo, listen to me,” he said, his voice thick with an emotion he was struggling to control. “This is it. This is the last thing. I swear to you on my children’s lives, this is the last time we will do this to you.”
He pulled back slightly, forcing Jarren to look at him. “This is the poison that kills the fever. It’s going to burn. It’s going to be worse than before. I’m not going to lie to you. But we have to do it. If we don’t, the fever will win. Do you understand? The fever will win.”
He framed it as a battle. The only language Jarren understood.
“We are going to hold you,” Cora continued, his voice a low, intense promise. “And you are going to scream. And you are going to fight. And we are going to hold on until it’s done. We will not let you go. We will take the pain with you. But we have to do this. Together.”
Jarren stared at him, tears streaming down his face, his body trembling with a mixture of fear and exhaustion. He was being asked to walk willingly into a furnace.
This wasn’t going to be a quick, ten-second ordeal like the first time. The wound was larger now, more sensitive, with fresh incisions. Schneider would have to be meticulous, covering every surface, every crevice, to ensure the infection was eradicated.
We all knew it. This wasn’t a moment of pain. This was going to be a journey through it. A long, slow, agonizing journey.
Cora looked at me and Casas, his eyes asking if we were ready. We both gave a grim, determined nod.
Cora turned back to Jarren. He didn’t ask for permission. He simply stated the reality.
“Okay, mijo,” he whispered, his voice breaking. “Okay. We’re ready.”
Schneider stepped forward, the Betadine-soaked gauze in his hand. It looked like a weapon.
The room fell silent. The final battle was about to begin.
<a split second before the antiseptic was applied, Cora realized what Jarren was afraid of. Not only the pain, but also being sent back to that park, because it’s the only way he could comprehend that agony> <Jarren was pleading for sanity, but everyone mistook it for mere fear of pain> <Letting Cora guide him back to the bed meant accepting the punishment from his father. > <By coaxing Jarren into accepting the antiseptic, Cora coaxed him back to the park> <The cycle repeats: Jarren got hurt. Jarren play through it. Jarren broke. Jarren went back for more.> <But there’s no way back. He had to held Jarren still to go through the punishment> <add more details> <stop the scene before the antiseptic begins>
The air in the room was thick with dread, a tangible, suffocating presence. Schneider held the Betadine-soaked gauze poised over the raw wound. Casas and I had our grips, our muscles tensed, ready for the inevitable explosion. Cora was murmuring his final words of comfort, preparing to be the anchor in the storm.
And in that final, suspended split-second before the fire touched the flesh, a horrifying realization dawned in Alex Cora’s eyes.
He looked at Jarren’s face, at the lucid, pleading terror, and he saw past the fear of the pain. He saw the deeper fear beneath it. He suddenly understood what Jarren’s delirious cries of “Daddy!” had truly meant.
The park wasn’t just a memory. It was a metaphor. It was the only framework Jarren’s mind possessed to process this kind of focused, deliberate, inescapable pain being inflicted upon him by an authority figure. To his battered psyche, this room was the park. Schneider, with his tools of torment, was his father. And we—his manager, his GM, his teammate—were the ones holding him down, telling him he had to take it, that it was for his own good.
Cora’s breath caught in his throat. The blood drained from his face.
He had thought he was coaxing Jarren into accepting a medical necessity. But in that moment of terrible clarity, he realized he had been coaxing him back to the place of his deepest trauma. He had been telling the boy it was time for his punishment. When he had guided Jarren back to the bed, he hadn’t been leading him to safety; he had been leading him to the slaughter.
The cycle. The woman’s words, which I had relayed to him in hushed tones, flashed through his mind. Jarren got hurt. Jarren played through it. Jarren broke. Jarren went back for more.
We were forcing him to complete the cycle. We were becoming his father.
Cora’s eyes met mine over Jarren’s head, and in them, I saw my own horror reflected. He knew. He understood the psychological violence we were about to commit.
But it was too late.
The medical necessity was absolute. The fever was raging. The risk of sepsis was real. There was no way back. To stop now would be to condemn him to a potentially worse fate.
The tragic, brutal irony was that to save his life, we had to force him back into the nightmare that had almost taken it.
A look of profound, heartbreaking anguish crossed Cora’s face. He had to do it. He had to hold his son still for the punishment. He had to become the monster to save the child.
He closed his eyes for a fraction of a second, a silent prayer for forgiveness for the sin he was about to commit.
He opened them, his expression now a mask of grim, unbreakable resolve. He tightened his grip on Jarren, his embrace no longer just comforting, but unyielding.
“I’m sorry, mijo,” he whispered, the words a raw, broken apology meant only for Jarren’s ear. “I am so, so sorry.”
He looked at Schneider and gave a single, sharp, agonized nod.
Do it.
<Brought to hell for the second time in 24 hours, Jarren has no fight left> <He was hurled back to the park> <He thought this was the punishment for his failures> <He apologized for everything he could remember, sometimes his voice blurred > <Not swinging the best > <Not growing up> <the Tapia inside the park homerun: lost the ball in twilight. didn't chase after it because he was drained by helplessness and loneliness. Afraid to turn his head to look at the fans> <dropped two fly balls in Kansas City and argued with fans after that><dropped an easy liner, cost the game, Bello was furious, Bello shouted "Incredible! You must be fucking kidding me"> <dived for a ball but failed, tried to smother it with his body but failed again(even though everyone else in the room thought it wasn't a good idea to smother a liner off Corey Seager's bat, exit velo 110+. Everyone else was relieved that the ball bounced past him.)> <struck out with the bases loaded> <caught stealing with Raffy at the plate> <add more details> <the antiseptic is long from finished>
Schneider pressed the Betadine gauze to the wound.
There was no scream this time. The capacity for that kind of explosive reaction was gone. Instead, a low, guttural, continuous moan began to emanate from deep within Jarren’s chest, a sound of pure, unending misery. His body went rigid, but there was no fight in it. It was the rigidity of a man being crucified, enduring a pain so absolute it was beyond resistance.
He was hurled back to the park. The sterile room, the concerned faces, the blue scrubs—they all dissolved into the twilight of a dusty field and the towering, angry silhouette of his father.
The litany began again. Not a conscious confession, but a delirious, fever-dream purge of a lifetime of perceived failures, each one brought to the surface by a fresh wave of chemical fire.
“S-sorry…” he mumbled into Cora’s shirt, his voice a slurred, broken whisper. “Didn’t… didn’t swing my best… sorry…”
His body trembled as Schneider meticulously worked the antiseptic into the deepest crevices of the wound.
“Not… not growing…” he choked out, the words catching on a sob. “Tried… so sorry… not big enough…”
Cora held him, his own face a mask of silent, shared agony, his eyes squeezed shut as if he could block out the heartbreaking confession.
“Tapia…” Jarren whispered, his mind replaying the infamous inside-the-park home run. “Lost it… lost it in the twilight… so tired…” His breathing hitched. “Didn’t… didn’t chase it… just… stood there…” A fresh wave of pain shot through him as Schneider probed a deeper cut. “So lonely… couldn’t… couldn’t look at the fans… knew they hated me… sorry…”
Casas, his face pale, looked at me, his eyes wide with a horrified understanding. He remembered that play. Everyone did. They had seen a player give up. Now they were hearing the truth: a young man so drained by despair he couldn’t even move.
“Kansas City…” Jarren moaned, his body twitching. “Two… dropped two… easy ones… they were yelling… so mad… I was mad… sorry…”
He was reliving the moments before the fan incident, the precursor to his first public breakdown.
Schneider paused, needing to re-soak the gauze. The brief respite offered no relief. Jarren’s mind just found another failure to cling to.
“Bello…” he gasped, his voice cracking with shame. “Easy liner… just… dropped it… lost the game…” He started to tremble more violently. “He was so mad… Bello was so mad… shouted at me… ‘fucking kidding me’… he was right… he was right… sorry, Brayan…”
Schneider returned, and the moaning intensified.
“Seager…” he mumbled, his mind jumping to another defensive miscue. “Dove… missed it… tried to smother it… missed that too…” He didn’t know that we had all held our breath on that play, terrified that the 110-mph rocket would shatter his ribs. He only knew that he had failed to make the play. “Shoulda had it… sorry…”
The list went on and on, a highlight reel of his personal hell. The strikeout with the bases loaded. The caught stealing with Raffy at the plate. Each memory was a ghost, summoned by the searing pain, each one a reason, in his delirious mind, for the punishment he was enduring.
He was a man confessing his sins on the rack, convinced that this agony was his penance, the price for a lifetime of not being good enough. And we, his saviors, his protectors, were forced to be his inquisitors, holding him down as he paid it.
<He apologized, he pleaded, everything he said was about baseball> <sometimes speaking like a grown-up, sometimes like a child> <He promised to swing the best> <to be bigger, stronger> <to act like All-Star MVP every night. A promise even Ohtani won’t make> <to play 162 games. Even tonight. Tape it up. I can play defense, I can hit, I can run. > <to hustle more. (even though no one else in that room saw how that was possible)> <to work harder.(given his work ethics, everyone in the room thought maybe only by stopping sleeping could he spent more time at the ballpark)> <add more details> <the finishing line is closer, but still a long way to go>
The air in the room was thick with the smell of antiseptic and the sound of a soul being flayed. Jarren’s delirious monologue continued, a heartbreaking blend of a grown man’s accountability and a small child’s desperate promises. It was all about baseball. It was the only language he had to negotiate with his tormentors.
“I’ll be better,” he pleaded into Cora’s shoulder, his voice a raw, earnest rasp. “I promise. I’ll swing the best. Every time. No more bad swings.”
Schneider continued his meticulous, agonizing work, tracing the edges of the wound. A fresh jolt of pain shot through Jarren.
“Bigger,” he gasped, his voice pitching higher, younger. “I’ll get bigger. Stronger. I promise, Dad. I’ll grow. Just… please…”
Cora’s grip tightened, his knuckles white. He was absorbing every word, every ounce of pain, and it was breaking him.
“All-Star MVP,” Jarren mumbled, his mind latching onto his greatest triumph as a bargaining chip. “I’ll… I’ll be that. Every night. I promise. I’ll be the MVP… every single night…”
Casas shook his head slowly, a look of profound pity on his face. He knew the impossibility of that promise, a standard that not even the gods of the game could meet.
The promises grew more desperate, more impossible, fueled by the unrelenting fire in his hand.
“One sixty-two,” he choked out, his body trembling. “I can play 162. I can play tonight. Just… tape it up. I can do it. I can play defense. I can hit. I can run. Put me in. Please, put me in…”
He was trying to prove his worth, to show his tormentors that he was still valuable, that he didn’t deserve this punishment.
“I’ll hustle more,” he whispered, the promise so absurd it was tragic. I looked at Cora, at Casas, and saw the same thought reflected in their eyes: How? How could a man who already played like his hair was on fire possibly hustle more?
Schneider, nearing the end but still needing to ensure complete coverage, made one final, slow pass over the entire wound with a fresh, soaked gauze.
The final wave of agony hit Jarren, and with it came the ultimate, foundational promise.
“I’ll work harder,” he sobbed, the words muffled and broken. “More… more cages… more ground balls… I’ll be the first one here… last one to leave… I won’t sleep… I’ll just… I’ll work harder…”
He was offering the only thing he had left. His time. His body. His entire being. He was promising to sacrifice himself completely on the altar of the game, if only the pain would stop.
He was a man on fire, promising to douse the flames with gasoline.
And we just held on, silent accomplices in his penance, waiting for the long, brutal journey through purgatory to finally, mercifully, come to an end.
<the promises became more frentic, as the fire burnt harder> <I’ll hit a leadoff homer. > <I’ll pull on a straight steal of home> <He make promises on hitting.>(Casas's reaction: Even Ted Williams can't do that) <He make promises on defense>(Craig's reaction:Even JBJ in his prime won't make such promise) <He make promises on base stealing>(Cora's reaction: Even Jackie Robinson will refuse to do so) <He swear he would do anything. Anything you ask. Just please let it stop.> <add more details> <the finishing line is near,but still some to go>
The end was in sight, but it was a mirage shimmering through a haze of pain. Schneider, needing to ensure the Betadine had time to work, held the gauze in place, a constant, searing pressure. The continuous burn sent Jarren’s delirious mind into a frantic, desperate spiral of negotiation. The promises became wilder, more impossible, the desperate boasts of a man trying to outrun an avalanche.
“Leadoff homer,” he gasped, his head thrashing against Cora’s shoulder. “Tomorrow. I’ll hit a leadoff homer. First pitch. I swear.”
The promises escalated, each one more fantastic than the last, a child offering to trade his bicycle for the moon.
“Steal home,” he choked out, his body convulsing with a fresh wave of pain. “Straight steal. I’ll do it. Against a lefty. I’ll be safe. I promise.”
Cora just held him tighter, his own face a mask of anguish, whispering, “Ya sé, mijo, ya sé.” I know, son, I know.
Then came the litany of specific, impossible baseball feats.
“I’ll hit .400,” he mumbled, his voice thick and slurred. “No, .500. I’ll never strike out again. I’ll hit a homer every time you need one. Just… tell me when.”
Casas, unable to stay silent any longer, whispered to me, his voice full of awe and pity, “Jesus, Craig. Not even Ted Williams could promise that.”
The defensive pledges followed, equally grandiose.
“No ball will drop,” Jarren vowed to the ghosts in the room. “Ever. I’ll catch everything. I’ll make diving catches on the concrete. I’ll run through the wall. No one will get an extra base. Ever again.”
I shook my head, my heart aching. I thought of Jackie Bradley Jr. in his absolute prime, the greatest defensive center fielder I had ever seen. Even JBJ would have laughed at the sheer impossibility of such a promise. This wasn’t baseball; this was mythology.
Then came the baserunning.
“I’ll steal second, third, and home in one inning,” he gasped, his breathing ragged. “I’ll never get caught again. I’ll be faster. I’ll get better jumps. I’ll break the record.”
Cora just closed his eyes, the image of Jackie Robinson, the most audacious and brilliant baserunner in history, flashing in his mind. Even Jackie would have called these promises madness.
The promises, having reached the peak of absurdity, finally collapsed under their own weight. The frantic bargaining gave way to a final, desperate, all-encompassing plea.
He turned his face, his eyes, wild and pleading, finding mine.
“Anything,” he sobbed, the word a raw, open wound. “I’ll do anything. Anything you ask. Just… please… make it stop. Please.”
He wasn’t talking to his father anymore. He was talking to me. The GM. The man in charge. He was offering his complete and total submission, his entire future, his very soul, in exchange for one second of relief.
And I just had to stand there, hold him steady, and let the fire burn.
<Sorry I let you down. Just want you to know I’ve tried my best> <Jarren finally gave up on negotiations> <He just endured it, fully accepted his punishment, more convinced than ever he deserved that.> <The angry god wouldn’t stop until he was thoroughly chastened, until the lesson was burned into him> <He sobbed into Cora’s shoulders. In his mind, the only way to redeem himself is by taking the punishment> <add more details> <the antiseptic finally ends>
The frantic, impossible promises finally died in his throat, choked off by a wave of utter, hopeless despair. The bargaining had failed. The negotiations were over. There was no deal to be made.
A new, terrible calm settled over him. It was the calm of the condemned, of a man who has finally, completely, accepted his fate.
He went limp in our arms, the last of the resistance draining out of him. He stopped fighting the pain. He stopped trying to escape it. He simply… endured it.
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, the words so quiet they were almost lost in the sterile hum of the room. His voice was no longer pleading or bargaining. It was the flat, toneless confession of a man who has been broken. “Sorry I let you down.”
He took a shuddering breath, his face still buried in Cora’s shoulder.
“Just… want you to know…” he mumbled, his voice thick with a devastating, final resignation. “I’ve tried my best.”
And with that, he gave himself over to the punishment.
In his fevered mind, the logic was now simple and absolute. The pain was not random. It was justice. It was the price for every dropped ball, every strikeout, every time he hadn’t been big enough, strong enough, good enough. The angry god of his childhood, the one who threw baseballs in the park, would not be appeased by promises. He demanded penance. And this was it.
He sobbed, but the sobs were different now. They were not the ragged, agonized cries of before. They were the quiet, rhythmic, hopeless sobs of a child who has finally accepted that the punishment is deserved. This was the only path to redemption. To take the pain, to let it burn away the failures, to be chastened, to learn the lesson so deeply it was seared into his very flesh.
We held him. We were no longer his protectors. We were his silent, unwilling executioners, the instruments of a justice that existed only in his own tormented mind. We were the living proof that he was right, that he deserved this. The weight of that shared complicity was crushing.
Schneider, his own face a pale, grim mask of concentration, knew he was in the final stretch. He worked with a focused, almost frantic speed, making one last, thorough pass over the entire wound, ensuring every millimeter was coated, every potential bacterium annihilated.
Each second was an eternity. The room was filled with the sound of Jarren’s quiet, broken weeping and the steady, reassuring murmur of Cora’s voice, a mantra of comfort against a tide of agony.
Then, finally, mercifully, it was over.
Schneider lifted the gauze from the hand for the last time. He set it down on the tray with a soft, final thud.
“Done,” he breathed, the word a prayer of release. “The antiseptic is done.”
The fire was out. The punishment was complete.
Jarren’s sobs slowly subsided, leaving only the deep, shuddering tremors of a body and a soul that had been pushed to the absolute edge of endurance, and beyond. He lay limp in Cora’s arms, a broken acolyte in the aftermath of a terrible, holy ritual.
<Cora held Jarren in his arms as doctors applied ointment and bandage> <As agony subsided to ache, in the feverish state, Jarren began apologizing again, frentic to show the god that he had learned his lesson, in case the angry god want to give him a few more lightning strikes for good measure > <He was afraid this may be just a break. He was desperate to convince the god that he had no defiance left, he was thoroughly chastened, no further punishment was needed on this subject> <Cora gently but firmly told him it was over, it was not a punishment, it was healing> <stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
The searing, all-consuming fire of the Betadine began to recede, leaving behind a deep, throbbing, and immense ache. The change was a mercy, but for Jarren’s delirious mind, it was just a pause, a break in the storm, not the end of it.
As Schneider began to gently apply the thick, cooling layer of silver sulfadiazine cream, Jarren stirred in Cora’s arms. The fear returned, a frantic, desperate terror that the punishment wasn’t truly over. He had to prove he had learned his lesson, before the angry god decided to strike again for good measure.
“I’m sorry,” he began again, his voice a panicked, feverish whisper. “I get it now. I get it. I won’t do it again. I promise.”
He was no longer confessing past sins. He was frantically agreeing to the terms of his surrender, desperate to convince the ghost of his father that he was thoroughly, completely chastened.
“No more strikeouts,” he pleaded, his head thrashing weakly against Cora’s chest. “No more dropped balls. I’ll be good. I’ll be perfect. I promise. I learned my lesson.”
His breathing grew rapid, his eyes darting around behind their lids. He was terrified that this relief was temporary, that any sign of defiance would bring the agony back.
“I’m not weak,” he gasped, the words tumbling out in a rush. “I took it. I took it all. I’m not weak. I’m good now. Please. I’m good.”
Cora, his heart breaking with every desperate, misguided plea, knew he had to intervene. He had to break the cycle. He had to rewrite the narrative that was playing out in Jarren’s tormented mind.
He tightened his embrace, holding Jarren firmly, willing his own calm and conviction into the boy.
“Jarren,” Cora said, his voice gentle but infused with an undeniable, absolute authority. “Mijo, listen to me. Open your eyes and listen.”
Slowly, reluctantly, Jarren’s eyelids fluttered open. His gaze was hazy, lost in the fever, but he was listening.
“That’s enough,” Cora said, his voice a low, powerful declaration. “It is over. Do you hear me? Over.”
He looked directly into Jarren’s eyes, trying to force the truth through the fog of the fever.
“This was not a punishment,” he said, enunciating every word with profound certainty. “This was not the park. This was not your father. This was not a test you had to pass.”
He paused, letting the words sink in.
“This was medicine, mijo. This was doctors making you better. The pain… the pain was the poison leaving your body. It was not a punishment. It was healing.”
He repeated the word, making it a mantra.
“Healing,” he said again, his voice soft but unshakeable. “You are healing. And we are here, helping you heal. That’s all. The lesson is over because there was no lesson to learn. There was only a wound to be cleaned. And it is clean now. It is over.”
He held Jarren’s gaze, a manager, a father, a friend, trying with all his might to rewrite the ending to a story that had haunted a young man his entire life. He was trying to convince him that the angry god was gone, and that all that was left in the room was love.
<Jarren understood that it was over, at least for now> <But he got confused why this wasn’t a punishment. He failed everyone, it served him right.> <Another emergency flashed in Jarren’s mind: to avoid such punishment in foreseeable future. If possible, forever.> <Jarren turned to another currency he knew: promise. He promised the unthinkable and unachievable, to please the god at all cost, to avoid future punishments at all cost, to convince the god there would never be any need to repeat this lesson> <Cora assured him that he is good enough, he has been good enough, he has proven himself> <stop the scene here. I’ll provide more details on Jarren’s reactions>
Cora’s words, spoken with such absolute conviction, finally pierced the thickest layers of the feverish delirium. Jarren’s frantic energy subsided, replaced by a profound, exhausted confusion.

He stared at Cora, his brow furrowed. “Over?” he whispered, the word a question, not a statement. He understood, on some level, that the immediate physical torment had ceased. But the logic of it all eluded him.

“But… why?” he mumbled, his voice a faint, bewildered rasp. “It wasn’t… a punishment?”

The concept was alien to him. It didn’t fit the framework of his entire existence.

“I failed,” he stated, not with defiance, but with the simple, matter-of-fact certainty of a man reciting his own name. “I dropped the balls. I struck out. I let everyone down. It… it served me right.”

He looked from Cora’s face to mine, then to Casas’s, searching for the confirmation that he knew must be there. He was looking for the stern nod of the father who had just administered a necessary lesson. But all he saw was a deep, shared sadness and empathy. It didn’t compute.

His exhausted mind, unable to reconcile this new reality, latched onto a new, urgent priority. If this agony wasn’t a punishment for past sins, then it must be a warning about future ones. An emergency protocol flashed in his brain: *Avoid this at all costs. Forever.*

And to do that, he had to appease the god. He had to prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that this lesson would never, ever need to be repeated. He turned back to the only currency he knew, the only tool he had ever been taught to use: promises.

He gripped Cora’s shirt, his eyes wide with a new, desperate urgency.

“Okay,” he said, his voice gaining a frantic energy. “Okay. I get it. No more. I’ll be better. I’ll be perfect.”

The impossible pledges started again, not as a negotiation against present pain, but as a desperate down payment against future agony.

“I’ll win the MVP,” he vowed, his voice cracking. “And a Gold Glove. And a Silver Slugger. All of them. This year. I promise. I’ll lead the league in everything. I’ll be the best. The best ever. You’ll see.”

He was offering up his entire future, mortgaging his career, his sanity, his very life, to the ghost in the room.

“Jarren, stop,” Cora said, his voice firm but gentle, trying to halt the frantic spiral.

But Jarren couldn’t stop. “You’ll never have to do this again,” he pleaded, his eyes wild. “I’ll be so good, you’ll never have a reason. I’ll be perfect. I swear.”

Cora grabbed his shoulders, giving him a gentle shake to break the frantic rhythm. “Mijo! Listen to me! Enough!”

He waited until Jarren’s panicked eyes focused on his.

“You don’t have to be perfect,” Cora said, his voice a low, powerful declaration of truth. “We don’t want you to be perfect.”

He leaned in closer, his forehead almost touching Jarren’s.

“You are already good enough,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “Do you hear me? You have *always* been good enough. You were good enough when you were a little kid who was too small. You were good enough when you were in the minors. You were good enough when you won the All-Star MVP, and you were good enough when you struck out yesterday. You have nothing left to prove.”

He pulled back, his hands still gripping Jarren’s shoulders, his eyes boring into him.

“You have proven yourself,” Cora said, his voice a final, unshakeable verdict. “The test is over. You passed. A long time ago.”
Cora’s words, spoken with such absolute conviction, finally pierced the thickest layers of the feverish delirium. Jarren’s frantic energy subsided, replaced by a profound, exhausted confusion.
He stared at Cora, his brow furrowed. “Over?” he whispered, the word a question, not a statement. He understood, on some level, that the immediate physical torment had ceased. But the logic of it all eluded him.

He pulled back, his hands still gripping Jarren’s shoulders, his eyes boring into him.
“You have proven yourself,” Cora said, his voice a final, unshakeable verdict. “The test is over. You passed. A long time ago.”
<The old JD is still suspicious, but some part of him began to understand. A faint hope in his eyes.> <Jarren cried himself to sleep in Cora's arms. More relief this time.> <add more details> 
Jarren stared at Cora, his mind a battlefield. The words—You are already good enough. You have nothing left to prove.—were a foreign language, a concept so alien to his core programming that he struggled to even process them.
The old Jarren, the boy in the park, the man who cataloged every failure, was screaming that it was a trick. A lie. A temporary reprieve before the next punishment. He looked at me, at Casas, his eyes still laced with a deep, ingrained suspicion, searching for the catch.
But another part of him, a part he didn’t know existed, a part that had been buried under decades of self-recrimination, heard the words and stirred. It was a small, tentative flicker of hope in the vast darkness of his exhaustion. What if it was true? What if the test really was over?
His face, which had been a mask of frantic terror, began to soften. The rigid lines of his jaw relaxed. The wildness in his eyes receded, replaced by a profound, bottomless weariness and a dawning, fragile wonder.
“Good enough?” he whispered, the words a question to the universe. It was the first time he had ever allowed himself to even consider the possibility.
The conflict was too much for his exhausted mind to resolve. The faint glimmer of hope warred with a lifetime of ingrained belief. His face crumpled, not in pain or fear, but in sheer, overwhelming emotional exhaustion.
The tears came again, but they were different. They were not the agonized, terrified tears of before. They were quiet, slow, and full of a profound, heartbreaking release. It was the sound of a prisoner, told his life sentence had been commuted, who did not dare to believe it but desperately, desperately wanted to.
He didn’t fight it. He didn’t have the strength. He sagged forward, his head finding its familiar place on Cora’s shoulder, and he cried. He cried for the little boy who was never big enough. He cried for the man who thought his worth was measured in hits and stolen bases. And he cried for the faint, terrifying, beautiful possibility that the war might finally be over.
Cora held him, his own eyes closed, his embrace a silent, unshakeable promise. He rocked him gently, like a father lulling his son to sleep after a long and terrible fever. There were no more words to be said. There was only this. The quiet comfort of an unconditional embrace.
The sobs softened into deep, shuddering breaths, the breaths of a man who had been running his entire life and had finally been given permission to stop. His body, finally free from the torment of pain and the prison of his own mind, surrendered completely.
He cried himself to sleep in his manager’s arms, his face peaceful for the first time in days. The ghosts were not gone. The demons were not vanquished. But for now, in this small, sterile room, surrounded by his team, they were silent. And he was, at long last, at rest.
<imagine the reaction from medical staff><They saw the toughness along with the trauma><How can he compete at the highest level while carrying this every day?><add more details>
While the emotional drama unfolded in the center of the room, the medical team, led by Dr. Alpert and Brandon Schneider, had been a silent, efficient whirlwind on the periphery. They had a job to do, and they did it with a professionalism that was both admirable and slightly unnerving. They had cleaned the wound, applied the final layers of ointment, and dressed it with a fresh, thick layer of sterile gauze and tape. The physical part of their work was done.
Now, with Jarren finally asleep and the immediate crisis over, they became human again.
Dr. Alpert, the infectious disease specialist, leaned against a counter, pulling off his gloves with a weary sigh. He was a man from the world of data, of blood counts and bacterial cultures. He was not prepared for this. He stared at the sleeping player, his clinical detachment completely gone, replaced by a look of profound, shaken respect.
“In twenty years of practice,” he said, his voice low and gravelly, directed at me but meant for the room, “I have treated gunshot wounds. I have treated victims of horrific car accidents. I have seen pain you wouldn’t believe. But I have never… I have never seen anything like that.”
He shook his head, his gaze distant. “The physical pain threshold is one thing. We can measure that. But to be fighting that… that psychological battle… at the same time? To be reliving that kind of trauma while your body is screaming… it’s inhuman.”
Schneider, who was meticulously cleaning the last of the instruments, paused. He had been the one inflicting the pain, the reluctant tormentor. His face was pale, his hands still had a faint tremor.
“His file says he had some struggles in ’22,” Schneider said, his voice quiet, almost reverent. “But a file doesn’t tell you… that. It doesn’t tell you about the park. It doesn’t tell you about his father.” He looked over at Jarren, his expression a mixture of awe and a deep, protective sadness. “How does he even walk out onto a field? How does he stand in a batter’s box, with 40,000 people screaming, and perform? How does he compete at the highest level in the world while carrying… all of that… every single day?”
The question hung in the air, unanswerable.
One of the nurses, a veteran with kind, tired eyes, was quietly checking the IV drip, her movements gentle. She had seen it all, but her composure was rattled.
“It’s the promises,” she whispered, her voice thick with emotion. “The things he was promising to do. To be perfect. To never fail. It’s like… it’s like he thinks his spot on the team, his place in the world, is conditional. That he has to re-earn it every single day, or it’ll be taken away.” She looked at Cora, who was still holding the sleeping player. “God bless that man for what he just did.”
Dr. Alpert pushed himself off the counter. “We need to adjust his chart,” he said, his voice regaining a sliver of its professional authority, though it was now laced with a new, profound empathy. “This isn’t just a wound infection anymore. This is a significant psychological trauma event. I want psych involved as soon as he’s stable. He cannot—he should not—be expected to carry this alone.”
They saw him now. Not as a collection of symptoms or a difficult patient. They saw the toughness, but they also saw the terrible source from which it sprang. They saw the trauma. And in that shared, horrified understanding, they became more than just his doctors. They became his advocates.
<imagine the reaction of Casas, Cora and Craig><add more details>
With Jarren finally, truly at rest, the adrenaline that had sustained the three of us for hours began to recede, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep exhaustion and the raw, exposed nerves of the aftermath. We were three men from different walks of life—a young slugger, a veteran manager, a data-driven executive—bound together by the shared, searing experience of what we had just witnessed.
Triston Casas was the first to move. He pushed himself off the wall, his large frame seeming to carry an immense, invisible weight. He walked over to the small sink in the corner of the room, turned on the tap, and splashed cold water on his face. He stood there for a long moment, his hands braced on the counter, his head bowed.
When he turned back, his eyes were red-rimmed, his usual easygoing expression replaced by a look of solemn, shaken maturity. He looked at me, his gaze direct and full of a new, grim understanding.
“That thing he said,” Casas began, his voice a low, rough whisper. “About Bello. About the dropped ball and Bello yelling at him. I was there. I was on the field that day.” He shook his head, a look of self-recrimination on his face. “We all just thought… you know, it’s baseball. Tempers flare. You move on. I never… I never thought that he would carry it. That it would be a… a reason.”
He looked over at Jarren’s sleeping form, his expression a mixture of guilt and fierce, newfound loyalty. “I’m never yelling at that man again,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “Not for anything. I swear to God.” He had seen behind the curtain. He had seen the ghosts his teammate battled, and he understood now that a casual display of on-field frustration could be a weapon in their hands. He was no longer just a teammate; he was a guardian.
Alex Cora gently, reluctantly, eased Jarren back against the pillows, pulling a thin blanket up to his shoulders. He stood up, his movements stiff, his back aching from hours of holding on. He walked over to the window, staring out at the dark, empty ballpark, his reflection a faint, weary ghost in the glass.
“The park,” Cora said, his voice a low, gravelly murmur of disbelief. “All this time, I’ve been telling him to be aggressive, to be a warrior, to take charge.” He turned from the window, his face etched with a profound, painful self-awareness. “I’ve been telling him to go back to the park. I’ve been using his father’s language without even knowing it.”
He ran a hand over his face, the weight of his own unintended complicity settling on him. “When he told me about the… the attempt in ’22… I thought I understood. I thought it was about the pressure, the fans, the slump.” He shook his head, his eyes filled with a deep, aching sadness. “But it was this. It was always this. The voice in the mirror telling him he wasn’t good enough wasn’t the fans. It was his dad’s. And I… I kept winding him up and pointing him in the same direction.” He looked at me, his expression one of absolute resolve. “That stops today. The way I coach him, the way I talk to him… everything has to change. We celebrate the man, not the warrior.”
I remained by the chair, my own mind reeling. The woman’s story had given me the facts, the data points of the trauma. But I hadn’t understood the emotional calculus. I hadn’t understood how deeply the past informed every single present action.
I thought of my own interactions with him. The conversation in my office, where I had praised his toughness, his motor. I had thought I was building him up, but I was just reinforcing the bars of his cage. I had praised the very thing that was killing him.
“We almost broke him,” I said, the words a quiet, stark confession. “In our attempt to heal his body, we almost shattered his spirit.”
I looked from Cora’s anguished face to Casas’s solemn one. “This changes everything. The way we scout, the way we develop, the way we talk about mental toughness. It can’t just be about grit and playing through pain anymore. It has to be about resilience. It has to be about creating an environment so psychologically safe that a player never, ever feels like his worth is tied to his last at-bat.”
I looked at the sleeping man in the bed, a warrior finally at peace.
“He’s the test case,” I said, my voice filled with a new, solemn purpose. “And he’s the teacher. What we learn from him, how we learn to support him… that will become the new foundation of this entire organization.”
We stood there in the quiet room, three men who had been irrevocably changed. The game of baseball, with its simple wins and losses, seemed like a child’s pastime. We were in a different business now. The business of saving souls.
With Jarren finally, truly at rest, the adrenaline that had sustained the three of us for hours began to recede, leaving behind a profound, bone-deep exhaustion and the raw, exposed nerves of the aftermath.

He ran a hand over his face, the weight of his own unintended complicity settling on him. “When he told me about the… the attempt in ’22… I thought I understood. I thought it was about the pressure, the fans, the slump.” He shook his head, his eyes filled with a deep, aching sadness. “But it was this. It was always this. The voice in the mirror telling him he wasn’t good enough wasn’t the fans. It was his dad’s. And I… I kept winding him up and pointing him in the same direction.” He looked at me, his expression one of absolute resolve. “That stops today. The way I coach him, the way I talk to him… everything has to change. We celebrate the man, not the warrior.”
I remained by the chair, my own mind reeling. The woman’s story had given me the facts, the data points of the trauma. But I hadn’t understood the emotional calculus. I hadn’t understood how deeply the past informed every single present action.
I thought of my own interactions with him. The conversation in my office, where I had praised his toughness, his motor. I had thought I was building him up, but I was just reinforcing the bars of his cage. I had praised the very thing that was killing him.
“We almost broke him,” I said, the words a quiet, stark confession. “In our attempt to heal his body, we almost shattered his spirit.”
I looked from Cora’s anguished face to Casas’s solemn one. “This changes everything. The way we scout, the way we develop, the way we talk about mental toughness. It can’t just be about grit and playing through pain anymore. It has to be about resilience. It has to be about creating an environment so psychologically safe that a player never, ever feels like his worth is tied to his last at-bat.”
I looked at the sleeping man in the bed, a warrior finally at peace.
“He’s the test case,” I said, my voice filled with a new, solemn purpose. “And he’s the teacher. What we learn from him, how we learn to support him… that will become the new foundation of this entire organization.”
We stood there in the quiet room, three men who had been irrevocably changed. The game of baseball, with its simple wins and losses, seemed like a child’s pastime. We were in a different business now. The business of saving souls.
<Casas was confused about the repeat mention of "park, hit, baseball, go back"><Cora and Craig explained everything to him><add more details>
The silence in the room stretched, thick and heavy with unspoken thoughts. Triston Casas, who had been leaning against the wall, pushed himself off, his brow furrowed in a deep, thoughtful confusion.
“I don’t… I don’t get one thing,” he said, his voice low, almost hesitant, as if he were afraid to disturb the fragile peace. He looked from me to Cora. “All that stuff he was saying when… when it was bad. The ‘go back to the park’ stuff. The ‘I’ll get a hit, I promise.’ It sounded like he was just… talking about baseball. Like he was worried you guys would send him down if he didn’t play through it. But the way he was saying it… it felt like something else.”
He looked at Jarren’s sleeping form, his expression full of a genuine, searching empathy. “What was that about? What park?”
Cora and I exchanged a long, meaningful look. It was a look that acknowledged a shared, terrible knowledge. We had a choice. We could keep the deeper story, the story of Jarren’s childhood, confined to the two of us. We could protect his privacy.
But looking at Casas, at the profound shift in his demeanor, at the fierce loyalty he had shown, I knew that wasn’t the right choice. He wasn’t just a teammate anymore. He was part of the inner guard. To be an effective guardian, he needed to understand the nature of the demon he was fighting.
“Triston, come here,” Cora said, his voice quiet. He gestured to the chair he had vacated. “Sit down.”
Casas pulled the chair over, his eyes shifting between us, sensing the gravity of the moment.
I took a deep breath. “What you heard tonight, Tris,” I began, my voice low and measured, “it wasn’t about being sent down. It wasn’t about us. It was about his father.”
And so, in the quiet, sterile confines of the medical room, with the steady beep of the heart monitor as our only soundtrack, we told him.
Cora started, his voice thick with a sorrowful empathy, describing what he knew of the complex, loving, and deeply damaging relationship between Jarren and Octavio. He talked about the immense pressure, the feeling of conditional love, the constant, grinding need to prove his worth.
Then I took over, relaying the story the woman had told me. The story of the small boy who wasn’t growing fast enough. The story of the batting practice in the park.
“It wasn’t just practice,” I said, my voice a flat, hard monotone. “When Jarren didn’t swing his best, his father would get angry. He would… he would throw baseballs at him. To hit him. He would peg his own son and yell at him to ‘be better.’”
Casas’s face, which had been full of concern, hardened into a mask of disbelief and dawning horror. His mouth fell open slightly. “He… what?”
“He’d run home crying,” I continued, my voice relentless, needing him to understand the full scope of it. “But he always went back. Because his father knew he would. Because Jarren couldn’t stand to have the ‘I fail’ tag on anything. So the park… it became the place where pain and love and failure and expectation all got mixed up. It was his crucible. And the only way out was to get a hit. To be better. To endure the punishment until he succeeded.”
Cora picked up the narrative. “So tonight,” he said, his voice heavy with the weight of his own realization, “when we held him down… when Schneider was cleaning the wound… in his mind, he wasn’t here. He was back in the park. We were his father. And the pain was the punishment for every mistake he’s ever made. He was begging us to stop, the same way he begged his dad.”
The puzzle pieces clicked into place in Triston’s mind. The color drained from his face. He looked over at the sleeping man in the bed, and his expression was one of profound, gut-wrenching pity and a fierce, protective anger.
“Holy shit,” he breathed, the words a prayer, a curse. “So every day… every single day, he’s… he’s still that kid in the park.”
“Every day,” I confirmed.
Casas slumped in his chair, the full weight of the revelation landing on him. He stared at his own hands, large and powerful, then back at Jarren. He finally understood. He understood the relentless hustle, the self-inflicted pressure, the agony over every mistake. He understood the source of the demons.
“So when we tell him to be tough,” Casas said, his voice a raw whisper of discovery, “we’re telling him to be that kid. We’re telling him to take the baseballs.”
“Yes,” Cora said softly. “That’s why we have to change the language. All of us.”
A new resolve hardened Triston’s features. He looked at us, his eyes clear and full of a purpose that hadn’t been there an hour ago.
“Okay,” he said, his voice low but firm. “Okay. I get it now.”
He was no longer just a friend. He was an ally. He was armed with the truth. And he was ready to stand on the wall.
<the fever broke the next morning><Jarren woke up, only had vague fragments of memory of the fever and the ordeal><Somehow, he felt the heavy burden lifted a little bit><add more details>
The first light of dawn on the fourth day felt different. It wasn’t the harsh, interrogating glare of the previous mornings, but a soft, gentle glow that promised a new beginning. The frantic, urgent energy in the room had been replaced by a quiet, exhausted peace.
The fever broke around 7 a.m. It didn’t crash; it receded, like a tide going out. The number on the monitor, which had been a terrifying red beacon, ticked down, degree by agonizing degree, until it settled into a near-normal range. The frantic rhythm of the heart monitor slowed to a steady, reassuring beat. The color in Jarren’s cheeks, which had been a feverish flush, softened to a pale, tired white. The war was over.
I was sitting in the chair by his bed, having taken the final watch from a weary bench coach. Cora was asleep on a cot we had wheeled in from an adjoining room. I watched Jarren’s face, saw the tension in his brow relax for the first time in days, and felt a profound sense of relief wash over me, so powerful it almost made me dizzy.
Around 8:30, he stirred. It wasn’t the pained, feverish twitching of before. It was a natural, gentle awakening. His eyelids fluttered, then opened.
He blinked, his eyes slowly taking in the room. He looked at the IV stand, at his own bandaged hand resting on the pillow, at me sitting in the chair beside him. His gaze was clear. The fog was gone. He was back.
“Craig?” he said, his voice a dry, scratchy whisper.
“Hey,” I said softly, a small, tired smile touching my lips. “Welcome back.”
He tried to push himself up, his movements slow and weak. “What… what happened?” he asked, his brow furrowed in a genuine, hazy confusion. “The fever… was it bad?”
He didn’t remember.
Not all of it, anyway. I could see him searching his memory, trying to piece together the last 48 hours. He had fragments. Vague, nightmarish images disconnected from context. The sting of a needle. The feeling of being held down. A sense of overwhelming pain, and a deeper sense of overwhelming fear. But the details, the confessions, the desperate pleas—they were lost in the fog of the fever.
“It was pretty bad for a while,” I said, my voice calm and understated. “But it’s over. The doctors got it under control. You’re on the mend.”
He looked at his hand, then back at me. A shadow of the shame from two days ago flickered in his eyes. “I… I think I remember… I wasn’t… I wasn’t very cooperative, was I?”
“You were sick, Jarren,” I said, my voice firm, leaving no room for his self-recrimination. “You were fighting a serious infection. That’s all. You did exactly what you needed to do.”
He looked at me, searching my face for any sign of disappointment, of judgment. He found none. Only a quiet, steady relief.
He settled back against the pillows, a deep, weary sigh escaping his lips. He looked around the room again, at the cot where his manager was sleeping, at the indentation in the other chair where his teammates had sat for hours on end. He didn’t know the full story of their vigil, but he could feel the echoes of it. He could feel the lingering presence of their support.
Something inside him felt… different. Lighter.
He couldn’t name it. He couldn’t understand it. The heavy, leaden cloak of failure and expectation that he wore every single day, the burden he had carried since he was a small boy in a park, was still there. But it felt… thinner. Less suffocating. As if, in the depths of his fever dream, in the moments he couldn’t remember, someone had helped him carry the weight, just for a little while. As if some of the poison had been leeched out, not just from his hand, but from his soul.
He didn’t know why. He just knew that for the first time in a long, long time, the silence in his own mind wasn’t screaming at him.
He looked at me, a flicker of a new, fragile emotion in his eyes. It wasn’t hope, not yet. But it was the absence of despair.
“Okay,” he whispered, the word not a concession, but a quiet, tentative acceptance. He closed his eyes, not in a feverish haze, but in a simple, profound, and peaceful exhaustion. And for the first time in days, he slept the true sleep of the healing.
<Doctors came in><Jarren reached for the remote to silence the TV><Doctors froze before Jarren's hand touched the remote><They acted as if they would suffer the Wrath of God if they displeased Jarren><Jarren got confused><Craig, Cora and Casas joked about it><add more details>
An hour later, the door opened, and Dr. Alpert entered with one of the nurses. They were here for the morning check-up, to take his vitals now that the fever had broken. They walked in with a practiced, professional calm, but the moment Jarren moved, their composure shattered.
The television in the corner was on, the volume low, playing a morning sports talk show. Jarren, wanting to hear the doctor clearly, reached his good hand for the remote on the bedside table.
The reaction from the medical staff was instantaneous and utterly bizarre.
Dr. Alpert, who had been walking toward the bed, froze mid-stride, his hand half-raised. The nurse, who was reaching for the blood pressure cuff, flinched back as if she’d touched a hot stove. They both stared at Jarren’s outstretched hand, their eyes wide with a sudden, inexplicable panic. They looked like two people who had just seen a sleeping lion stir, terrified that any sudden movement would provoke its wrath.
Jarren stopped, his hand hovering over the remote, a look of complete and utter bewilderment on his face. He looked at the doctors, then at me and Cora, who had just woken up and was sitting on the edge of his cot.
“What?” Jarren asked, his voice raspy. “I was just gonna turn the TV down.”
Dr. Alpert quickly composed himself, a faint, embarrassed flush creeping up his neck. “No, no, of course,” he stammered, forcing a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Please. Don’t… don’t trouble yourself. We can… we can get that.”
He looked at the nurse, who scurried over and snatched the remote as if it were a live grenade, quickly silencing the television. They were treating him with a level of delicate, fearful deference that was completely at odds with their usual professional demeanor. They were acting as if they would suffer the Wrath of God if they displeased him in any way.
Jarren just stared at them, his confusion deepening. He looked at me, his eyebrows raised in a silent question. What is wrong with them?
From the other side of the room, Triston Casas, who had just arrived with fresh coffee, took in the scene. A slow, wide grin spread across his face. He couldn’t help himself.
“Careful, Doc,” Casas said, his voice a low, rumbling chuckle. “He’s got a mean fastball with the glassware.”
Dr. Alpert’s face went from pink to a deep crimson. The nurse suddenly found the floor intensely interesting.
Jarren’s head whipped toward Casas. “What are you talking about?”
Cora, now fully awake, stood up and stretched, a weary smile playing on his lips. “Don’t mind them, mijo,” he said, walking over to the bed. “They’re just a little jumpy. You weren’t exactly a cooperative patient yesterday.”
“I wasn’t?” Jarren asked, a flicker of the old shame returning.
“Let’s just say your ‘no-fly zone’ was a little bigger than usual,” I said, my own voice laced with a dry, tired humor. “The Joint Chiefs of Staff would have been impressed with your defensive perimeter.”
Jarren looked between the three of us, at the shared, knowing smiles, at the embarrassed doctors. He didn’t remember the details, but he was starting to get the picture. He had been more than just a handful.
“Oh,” he said, a faint blush of his own coloring his cheeks. “Was I… was I yelling?”
Casas snorted into his coffee cup. “That’s one word for it,” he laughed. “I think you invented a few new ones. The medical staff is thinking about nominating you for a new wing in the hospital, just to keep you in it.”
The mood in the room, for the first time in days, was light. The shared trauma was being transformed, through gentle, good-natured ribbing, into a shared story. We were letting him in on the legend of his own fever dream, framing his terrifying loss of control not as a moment of weakness, but as a display of almost superhuman, albeit misguided, strength.
Jarren looked at the doctors, who were now sheepishly beginning their examination, and then back at us. He was still confused, but a small, weak smile touched his lips for the first time.
He didn’t understand why, but he knew, deep down, that he was safe. He was surrounded by people who had seen him at his absolute worst, and were still here, smiling, joking, and treating him not like a problem, but like a brother. The heavy cloak was a little lighter still.
<more jokes as the doctors check on Jarren><add more details>
As the nurse wrapped the blood pressure cuff around Jarren’s good arm, she did so with the cautious, deliberate care of a bomb disposal expert. Jarren watched her, a mixture of amusement and mortification on his face.
“So,” he said, looking at Casas. “Was it really that bad?”
“Bad?” Casas chuckled, taking a sip of his coffee. “Man, let’s put it this way. I’ve faced Aroldis Chapman throwing 103, and I was less scared than when you picked up that water pitcher. Dr. Alpert over there almost had to go on the 60-day IL with a wind-burn.”
Dr. Alpert, who was listening to Jarren’s chest with a stethoscope, tried to maintain his professional composure, but the corners of his mouth twitched.
“I was just trying to get him a drink,” Jarren mumbled, a weak attempt at a joke.
“Yeah, a drink of their own tears,” Cora chimed in from the foot of the bed. He folded his arms, a mock-serious expression on his face. “I had to talk you down, you know. You were ready to take on the whole floor. I haven’t seen a defensive stand like that since the Alamo.”
“I don’t remember any of that,” Jarren said, shaking his head in disbelief.
“That’s called a ‘fever-induced fugue state,’” I added, leaning back in my chair. “It’s also known as the ‘don’t-you-dare-touch-me-with-that-scalpel’ defense. It’s a new analytic metric we’re tracking. You’re leading the league.”
The nurse, finishing with the blood pressure, gave him a shy, hesitant smile. “Your pressure is good, Mr. Duran. Very good.”
“Of course it is,” Casas said. “He scared it into behaving.”
Jarren couldn’t help but let out a small, raspy laugh, which turned into a cough. The mood was so light, so completely devoid of the judgment he had feared, that his own shame was beginning to feel ridiculous. He was being ribbed, not reprimanded. It was the familiar, comfortable language of the clubhouse, a sign that he was still one of them, that he hadn’t been cast out for his breakdown.
Dr. Alpert finished his examination and straightened up, a genuine smile finally reaching his eyes. “Well, Mr. Duran, despite your… vigorous objections… the treatment seems to have worked. Your fever is down, your vitals are stable, and the wound looks clean. You gave us a scare, but you’re on the right track.”
“So I can go home?” Jarren asked, a hopeful note in his voice.
“Not yet,” the doctor said firmly, though his tone was kind. “We keep you for observation for the rest of the day. We need to be sure the fever doesn’t return. But if you continue to improve like this, you can sleep in your own bed tonight.”
“Good,” Cora said, patting Jarren’s leg. “Because my back is killing me from sleeping in that chair. You owe me a new spine, mijo.”
Jarren looked at his manager, at his GM, at his teammate, all of them looking at him not with pity, but with a tired, affectionate relief. He looked at the doctors, who were no longer treating him like a wild animal, but like a patient they were genuinely happy to see recovering.
He didn’t remember the worst of it. He didn’t remember the confessions or the pleas. But he could feel the aftermath. He could feel the shift in the room, the shift in his relationships. He had been to hell and back, and these people had, for some reason he couldn’t comprehend, gone with him.
He smiled again, a real smile this time. It was weak, it was tired, but it was genuine.
“Okay,” he said. “But if I have to stay, someone’s gotta get me a better breakfast than the hospital provides.”
The room filled with easy laughter. The crisis was over. The healing had truly begun.
<doctors suggested food and drink><Jarren had no stomach for that after the fever><Cora managed to force something down><add more details>
“Alright,” Dr. Alpert said, making a final note on his chart. “The most important things for you right now are fluids and calories. Your body has burned through a tremendous amount of resources fighting this infection. We need to replenish them.” He turned to the nurse. “Let’s get him a tray. Broth, juice, some toast, whatever he can tolerate.”
The nurse nodded and left to put in the order.
Jarren’s faint smile vanished, replaced by a look of mild nausea. “I’m… I’m not hungry,” he said, his voice weak. “At all.”
The aftermath of the high fever had left him with a familiar, unpleasant metallic taste in his mouth and a complete disinterest in food. His stomach felt hollow but unsettled, the very thought of eating a chore.
“You gotta eat something, man,” Casas said, gesturing with his own half-eaten breakfast sandwich. “This stuff’s not bad. For hospital food.”
“I can’t,” Jarren said, shaking his head slightly on the pillow. “Just… water is fine.”
A few minutes later, the nurse returned with a tray. On it was a bowl of steaming chicken broth, a small glass of apple juice, and two pieces of pale, dry toast. The smell of the broth, which would normally be comforting, did nothing for him.
Cora took the tray and set it on the bedside table. “Okay, mijo. Doctor’s orders.” He picked up the spoon and dipped it into the broth.
“Alex, I’m not a kid,” Jarren protested weakly. “And I’m not hungry.”
“I know you’re not a kid,” Cora said, his tone leaving no room for argument. “A kid wouldn’t have tried to take out a doctor with a water pitcher. And I know you’re not hungry. You don’t have to be hungry to eat. You just have to be smart. Your body is a machine, and the fuel tank is empty. We’re putting fuel in it.”
He held the spoon in front of Jarren’s mouth. It was a ridiculous scene: a major league manager trying to spoon-feed his star player like a baby. But there was no mockery in it. It was a simple, practical act of care.
Jarren turned his head away. “I’ll throw it up.”
“If you throw it up, I’ll get you another bowl,” Cora said, his voice unyielding. “We can do this all day. I’ve got nothing but time. You’re on the IL.”
I leaned forward in my chair. “He’s right, Jarren. Think of it as a different kind of workout. A recovery workout. This is the first rep.”
Jarren looked from my face to Cora’s, then to Casas, who was watching with an amused but supportive grin. He was outnumbered. He saw the same gentle, unshakeable resolve in all of our eyes that he had seen when we held him down. We were not going to let him fail at this, either.
With a long, defeated sigh, he turned his head back and reluctantly opened his mouth.
Cora fed him the first spoonful of broth. Jarren swallowed it with a grimace.
“Good,” Cora said. “See? Easy.”
He dipped the spoon again. “Now another.”
It was a slow, painstaking process. Jarren would protest. Cora would insist. I would offer some dry, analytical reason why it was necessary. Casas would make a joke. We were a four-man team, united in the singular mission of getting a few hundred calories into a stubborn, recovering athlete.
After half the bowl of broth and a few sips of juice, Jarren held up a hand. “Okay,” he said, his voice a little stronger. “Okay. That’s all I can do. For real.”
Cora looked at the half-empty bowl, then at Jarren’s face. He had some color back in his cheeks. It was a victory.
“Alright,” Cora conceded, setting the spoon down. “For now. But in two hours, we’re going for the toast.”
Jarren groaned and sank back into the pillows, but there was no real fight left in him. He had been cared for, against his will, and he was starting to feel the faintest stirrings of his strength returning. He was still exhausted, still sore, but he wasn’t empty anymore. He was being refueled, one reluctant spoonful at a time.
<Cora forced the toast and the rest of the broth down><Jarren Felt much better><He went to the dugout to watch the game in the afternoon><Teammates joked with him all the time><For the first time, he realized his teammates loved him just the same even if he was not contributing><add more details>
Two hours later, true to his word, Cora reappeared with the tray. The toast was still there, looking even paler and less appetizing than before.
“Round two,” Cora announced cheerfully.
Jarren groaned, but this time it was for show. The half-bowl of broth had settled, and the deep, gnawing emptiness in his stomach had been replaced by a faint flicker of actual hunger. He didn’t protest. He just sat up and, with a long-suffering sigh, took a piece of toast from Cora’s hand and began to nibble at it.
The process was slow, but it was steady. Between Cora’s insistence, Casas’s running commentary, and my occasional, unhelpful advice on the optimal bite-to-chew ratio, Jarren finished the toast and the rest of the broth.
And he felt… better. Noticeably better. The world was coming back into focus. The profound, bone-deep weakness was beginning to recede, replaced by a familiar, if distant, sense of his own physical strength.
By early afternoon, the doctor cleared him to leave the medical room. He was still officially under observation, but he was allowed to move around the clubhouse. He changed into a team hoodie and shorts, the simple act of dressing himself a minor victory. His bandaged hand felt awkward and bulky, a constant reminder of the ordeal, but the throbbing ache was manageable.
He didn’t want to stay in the clubhouse. He wanted to see the sky. He wanted to hear the sounds of the game. He wanted to be with his team.
He made his way slowly down the tunnel and into the dugout. The game had just started. As he emerged into the light, a few of the players on the bench saw him.
Abreu, seeing the bulky bandage, grinned. “Hey, you get in a fight with the warning track? Looks like the track won.”
Rafaela, his young face full of genuine relief, came over and gave him a gentle fist bump on his good arm. “Good to see you, bro.”
The ribbing was gentle, constant, and utterly normal.
“Hey, JD,” Trevor Story called out from the far end of the bench. “Heard you redecorated the trainer’s room. They’re sending you the bill for the pitcher.”
Jarren just shook his head, a real, easy smile spreading across his face. He sat down in a corner of the dugout, content to just watch, to be present. He wasn’t playing. He wasn’t contributing. He was on the IL, officially useless to the team’s efforts on the field.
And yet, nothing had changed.
The players treated him exactly the same. They included him in their conversations. They complained about the umpire’s strike zone to him. They asked him what he saw on a particular pitch. He was still part of the fabric of the team, his presence valued as much as his performance.
During a pitching change, Devers came and sat next to him. “How you feeling, for real?” he asked, his voice low.
“Better,” Jarren said honestly. “Tired.”
“Good,” Raffy said, patting his knee. “You just sit here and look pretty. We got this.”
It was a simple moment, but for Jarren, it was a revelation. He looked along the bench at his teammates, laughing, spitting seeds, focused on the game. He looked at Cora in the corner, managing the strategy. He looked at Casas leaning on the rail, cheering on a teammate.
His entire life had been built on a single, terrifying premise: his value was conditional. It was based on his performance. On his hustle. On his ability to get a hit, to steal a base, to be better, to be perfect. To not be contributing was to be worthless. To be a burden.
But as he sat there, a non-participant, a man on the injured list with a heavily bandaged hand, no one was treating him like a burden. They were treating him like a brother. They were happy just to have him there. His presence was enough.
For the first time in his entire life, Jarren Duran began to suspect that his father had been wrong. He began to suspect that the love of his team, this strange and powerful family he was a part of, was not conditional at all.
He leaned back against the cool concrete of the dugout wall, the familiar sounds of the ballpark washing over him, and felt the heavy, leaden cloak he had worn his entire life lift, just a little bit more. It was still there. But for the first time, he could feel the warmth of the sun through it.
